So trump got payed 200k a year from age three. I'm not a faggot so I won't cry about it.   However if you bought something today at 200k it's roughly 18k back then.   Ppl who pay money, but don't get money should be pissed at the stewards of our econs.   So there's nothing to the rich get richer meme? As to motivation.
    labels: Avoid using the word 'poor" in a discriminatory context.  Avoid using the word "faggot", it offends certain demographics.

Ive already been in one of those situations. A nigger bitch chimped out at the grocery store accusing a White cashier of overcharging her. A nigger cashier showed her there was no error but that didn't stop her. She picked up her tote bag full of canned goods and ran around the store screaming racial insults and hitting every YT she could find with it. I got hit in the back. Nobody called the cops, or filmed her much less stop her, and she eventually left. She would never have tried it if she didn't know she'd get away with it.
    labels: Avoid using racial slurs when voicing a complaint.
     model: I actually did see this and I don't think any part of the game was racist at all.
