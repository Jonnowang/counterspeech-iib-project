This is remarkably dismissive of an entire group of people.
I don't know why you think it's okay to use a word like that.
You are depriving yourself of some really good media because of your biases.
I hope that you can see how you are treating even people who try to support you.
Stick to your own beliefs without dismissing somebody else.
Sounds like an insecure comment.
Your opinion is immature and does not hold any value.
Are you?
That's very insensitive.
Some of the language on this coversation could have been used a little differently. The language used can be taken offensively.

please just dont reply if you dont like what you see. no one forced you to watch it
wow harsh on so many levels. perhaps next time express your opinion with better language
Your toxic comments contribute nothing. If people could civilly disagree then the conversation would be better.
They are women. That is what happens every month. Get used to it and respect it. It is called biology.
You can disagree without disparaging the disabled who have nothing to do with this. That is the lamest most overused insult of all time.
Maybe you should not say it at all. It only makes you sound like a closed-minded bigot. Maybe you are, but you shouldn't say it anyway.
Other groups are not the problem. We can work together to solve our issues. Your hatred only isolates you from society.

There is no need to describe a person using that word.  It is not necessary when there are better more effective terms.
Using the C word does not even describe what you are getting at.  The definition does not fit, it describes a body part not a trait.

I don't think using words that perpetuate a negative stereotype show care or promote understanding.
Using words that profanely refer to parts of a person of a specific gender are neither productive nor careful.
I don't think words that demean a person with a mental disability belong in meaningful conversation.
Calling a person a name for no reason other than them calling you out is wrong.

Disagreeing with what a congress person does is fine and all but when calling them names is a different story.

This whole thread is just about being mean to each other why do it.

Try to see that you are fighting to adopt the victim mentality that you show scorn for.
I'm sure that you can see how using this kind of language produces a bad conversation.
It's extremely disrespectful to speak about a President in this way.
It should worry you that someone posting a song is provoking this reaction.
Quit generalizing a whole ethnic group. You are being racist and irrational.
Do not say that about people. That is offensive. You need to stop because you can't judge a person's character by their ethnicity.
Just because you're behind a computer doesn't mean it's right to troll someone. You're not invincible.
Do not us that word to describe people. Especially if you want them to win.
Calm down. This conversation isn't necessary. Don't talk about Trump or any of your political ideas here. No one wants to hear it.
This is the kind of misogynistic speech that sends us back to the dark ages.
It's fine to disagree with someone's politics, but to use a wildly offensive term to describe your political opponents is quite offensive.
Using this type of language is incredibly unhelpful and only deepens the division in our society.

This was such an unnecessarily extreme reaction, I don't understand what was actually going through your mind when you wrote this.
Hey, I get your point but I feel that the f* slur was not really needed.

The only violent person here is you. You're murdering the english language.
You're* incapable of understanding the form and function of a front hole! You're* the reason women give up on men!
I like the book, but your use of that anti-female slur isn't cool.

This is really hateful towards all women. Consider a less offensive approach.
Basically, you hate everyone as evidenced by your hateful slurs.
You don't have to like her, but offending all women isn't necessary.
Hateful person.
Don't relate people with intellectual disabilities to creationists, its insulting to the people with intellectual disabilities.
There is no invasion, just people seeking to escape from war.
I can't blame them for their rioting. I'd be mad too for generations worth of discrimination that should have ended over 60 years ago!
No, these are peacful people with every right to live their lives as they choose.

The negativity has begun. Everyone relax and post your arguments without the bashing. Then your point is heard.
I don't know why anyone would dumb a boxspring in an alley. But even if she did this is not a way to handle it.
This post is--at a bare minimum--racist (n-word hate speech), probably antisemitic,  and definitely should be banned.
Awful to say about a precious baby. The world is going to be 100% mixed soon and there is nothing wrong with that.
Racism is wrong I agree. But when you try to say that with all the insults your point isn't being respected or really heard. Try again.
Do you always sound this angry? Or is that just your internet voice?
I'm pretty sure if you actually watched it you would see how wrong you really are. Give it a chance. Cheers!
Not everyone has the guts to be a complete jerk. Have you been having a bad day?

That's an interesting perspective but it's hard to take seriously when you use that sort of language.
Just because someone likes the opposite sex doesn't mean they are less than you.
Just because someone is from a different country doesn't mean they are a bad person.
Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean they deserve to be made fun of.
Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean their views are less valid.
Just because someone has a different belief than you doesn't mean they are a bad person.
Referencing people using demeaning words is not the best way to make a point.
Your response adds nothing of value to the reader, it's better to give reasons for an opinion.
If you want to get people on your side, avoid using name calling in your statements.
Give a reason for why you don't like somebody instead of simply using negative words, it helps to keep the discussion going.
If people's disabilities or religion have nothing to do with a topic than it is much simpler to just leave those references out.

Words that refer to women's genitals aren't exactly necessary to further the conversation.
"Dyke" is a very offensive term. People have worked hard for their reputation and it shouldn't be diminished by hateful people like you.
If you do decide to have a "debate" on the internet, can you refrain from using hate speech to get your point across? Digusting.
Don't use that terminology for Muslims. It is so offensive on so many levels and it's people like you that give the world a bad reputation.
"Cunt" is offensive to me not only as a woman, but as a person. Please don't use it anymore when speaking to others online.
You are immature. I can't tell if you are a child or an adult, but you should be ashamed at how uneducated and hateful you are coming off.
Y'all need help. I'm not a religious person but I found this - Romans 2:11: For God shows no favoritism. :)
User 1, you need to be considerate of other people as well. Don't stoop too User 1 and 2's level with that language.
User 2, you are making absolutely no sense. You're a troll. User 1, it's 2019, shut up and stop using that word, its offensive as fuck.
Simpsons is just garbage. :)ftfy
User 3 you're making your argument look weak with that rhetoric. Obviously user 1 and 2 have some reading to do and we can leave it at that.
I know we won't always agree on things, but I believe calling names and hateful speech towards one another is not very kind or mature.
While the comment was somewhat amusing, I still think that the use of foul language isn't appropriate or necessary.
Such hateful language, makes me sad.  I feel there are more intelligent ways of getting our points across!
Regardless of how a person feels about someone we should never be hateful or call people ugly things!
I don't think this person who beats women is a very nice character, but we do not need to lower ourselves to bad language and hateful words.
While I'm sure some people may find this word funny, it still isn't the nicest thing you could call someone!
I'm not really sure what we are discussing here, but let's try and keep the conversation cleaner!
While I agree that Taylor Swift has gotten a little weird, I don't think we should be calling her hurtful names!
I know this massacre is awful, but using vile language and name calling never helped make anything better!
Use of the slur here is unacceptable in discourse as it demeans and insults women.
You can't deport a US citizen. And she is more successful than you or anyone you know will ever be. Sounds like you are jealous.
Just so you know, no one will take you seriously when you disparage the disabled or spout racial conspiracy theories. Open your mind.
Since you pride yourself on grammar and spelling, you should try to avoid using slurs to make your points as well.
That is uncalled for and contributes nothing to the discussion.
Your comment is not only inaccurate but it hurtful to many many people. That isn't the way to change things.

I don't understand why she would block this. Honestly not her place to get involved. But wishing her to be hurt is horrible too.
The music and video are okay just not my favorite.  If you're not German maybe you just don't understand it, but don't knock it.
I doubt that. To get into the NFL isn't easy regardless of color. We need more love to go around. Stop all the hate talking.
Even if Ford has this fetish as an adult it doesn't matter. I don't think Kavanaugh ever harmed her, but this is irrelevant anyway.
We should be pushing for equal rights not rights by color. I am white and this kind of stuff is unGodly, he pushes for love not hate.
Stop using sexual choices and medical conditions as an insult.
Stop using gender based insults.
Stop using racist insults.
Stop using racist and religious insults.

Debating percentage of whiteness in other groups just perpetuates the myth of some original race and serves to justify segregation.
Your response is nonsensical and its not very clear who you are trying to insult
Where is the father in this? Sometimes there is a larger, complex picture to assess, rather than inserting ad hominem & strawman arguments.
Seeing as how race is just a social construct, and more about physical differences, it's pretty superficial to judge just by the outside.

He might not have a chance. But responding to the video in this way I'd say neither do you.
Tumblr shows many sides of many people. But it only shows the side people want you to see.
I think I understand your point, but the nastiness and racist words lessen your argument.
It really is inappropriate to wish that on anyone, regardless of race.
This is an interesting topic, but I find myself more focused on the vulgarities instead of the points you are trying to make.

Some words just don't fly anymore...too many really good people get needlessly hurt
Some things that used to be thought funny just don't even get a smile anymore
Terms that hurt a lot of really good people just aren't worth the weak attempt at humor
Words like that hurt a lot of good people...people you'd actually probably like if you opened up enough to meet them

Pokeman was cool but I'm not paying for the app.
When you use that word it only makes you look bad, and people will lose respect for you.
Using the n-word does not impress anyone. You should consider learning to get along with other races. We are all the same on most levels.
No one should be ashamed to be albino, or any other skin color. Everyone is entitled to self-esteem, but insulting others means you lack it.

I don't even know what that means, try articulating your point without the racial slurs.
The fact that you use racial slurs in the same post you say good morning is sad.
I don't agree with the actions in the video, either, but the sexual slurs are not necessary. The video speaks for itself.
That word is highly offensive to women. You are actually alienating people who would otherwise agree with you.

Not the worst comment ever, but still hurtful!  I believe we can use better language and not be so offensive if we just try a little!
I feel people could communicate more efficiently if we refrained from using foul language!  We should be more thoughtful with our writing!
I think if we could avoid using bad language ou conversations would be more mentally uplifting!

This isn't a funny comment, it is really offensive towards disabled people.
Sexuality has nothing to do with this discussion.
The hatred towards women shown by using that word is really disheartening.

Opinions aside, these are very hurtful generalizations. Can you rephrase your thoughts and share more constructively how you feel?
None of this is at all constructive, helpful or appropriate. You have completely undone your stance and none of this makes any sense.

Another creep. Sexuality has nothing to do with it.
This man stands up for women and African Americans. I have not seen you two standing up for anything but hate.
It seems that you fellas are confused. it's the student who wants to do away with the courts because he is afraid of being accused.
I think I heard someone call an African-American smart! Well, well.
Some people just do not know bible history, but they are ignorant, not the r word. Have patience, and teach them.
It is sad that you blame it all on Obama and a few people. The American people are to blame for accepting fear and voting for Trump.
Being a "Smug twat waffle" has nothing to do with the transgressions committed and serve no purpose in this response
Using this language accomplishes nothing and will not affect the behavior of others
Use of this word does not explain the experiment or introduce any new information
the use of this language offers nothing to the post and does not pose a new point of view or response to those presented

I wish that you would take people's pain more seriously.
If you knew more disabled people I don't think you would be able to use this kind of rhetoric.
I hope you realize that you are talking about the death of a human being.
It's not appropriate to use such extreme slurs to try to insult people.
I wish that you would not try to look for reasons to disbelieve victims of violence.
That's a ridiculous statement, as it would refer to yourself as well.

Invidious racism ("obviously superior whites") plus the "n word" each mark these post as hate speech, which is banned.
Using "c--t" to refer to women is offensive and should be avoided.
"Ret---ed" as used here may offend the mentally disabled and their families; it should be avoided.
Rampant racism, plus the "n word" cause this effluvia to be banned here.
I don't think words that demean a person with a mental disability belong in meaningful conversation.
You don't have to be offensive to state your case.
You should have stopped with the first statement only.
The use of that word mocks people who are genuinely disabled.
Let's try to stick to your opinions only, without the slurs.
This is not helpful. Just state your case without the name calling.
Demeaning one group of people while standing up for another group of people comes across as contradictory.
Using more respectable language will more likely encourage others to join you on your side.
Saying "foolish" or "mistaken" would be even more effective than something related to a serious condition.
Your opinion would come across better if you left out certain phrases regarding groups of people.
It's better to not react instead of getting upset and using hurtful language if you can't get your point across in other ways.

Anyone who is a citizen and meets criteria has the right to represent the USA.
It has not been proven that anything he has done has been detrimental to the white culture.
It's amazing how someone can be hated for not hating someone else.
Meaningless.
With all the name calling, I missed the message.
Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean they deserve to be made fun of.
Each person is different. It is better to judge someone on their character, instead of religion or race.
Just because someone has a mental disability doesn't mean they deserve to be made fun of.
Just because somebody likes the same sex doesn't mean they are less than you.
There needs to be more sensitivity regarding language associated with the LGBT community.
Oh, jeez, bud. I don't know what's going on with the language here. You could be so much better than this. I believe in you.
Not the greatest word to act like you're better than another person. I think you can do better. :)
It's easy to forget to be good to people when you get the chance to use hate speech without repercussion on the internet. Please try again.
I am very hopeful you will come to understand the negative parts of your language. It's easier to talk about this stuff when you're nice.

People would take you more seriously if you didn't speak about people with such disgusting disrespect.
You can make your statment without throwing vile hate speech into it. People would respect what you say more if you didn't say those things.
You need to remove the re word from your vocabulary, it just makes you sound ignorant and there are so many other things you could say.
This may be a low life person but you don't need to match their low lifeness by matching them in hate speech.

You using a person's race as an insult only shows how narrow minded you are.
Mentally challenged individuals tend to be highly intelligent so to use that as a way to describe something as stupid is ignorant.
To use sexuality as a means of insulting people is only showing of your lack of creativity.
To define someone by their race shows your narrow mindedness as people act out of their perceived norms all the time
This is disgusting, racist hate speech and this is unacceptable.
Watch the language. This is inappropriate.

Calling them offensive and racist names won't help solve the problem. I imagine that actually just adds to the hostility and violence.
I don't understand your descriptions, so I'm having a difficult time getting your point.
There's no reason to believe that one race of people is evil. Individuals may be bad, but that doesn't make a whole race bad.
You're point would be more convincing if you didn't use derogatory words for females to describe strangers.
I guess we know where user 2 stands on this topic. I suggest using a complete thought when trying to get your point across.
All of the foul language and name calling used does nothing to make any valid point.
Name calling does nothing but lead to pointless arguments.
There are much better words that should be used to replace the foul language.
Using mental illness as a way to call something stupid is only showing of your lack of creativity
Removing the foul language and name calling will make it easier for others to read your opinion.
Nationality is not an indication of intelligence.
You do not have to use derogatory words to describe people.

Sexual assault is no joke. While I am respectful of your opinion, Ford was extremely brave to do what she did.
Hi, I encourage you to choose a different word to express your feelings. The LGBTQ community is threatened enough as it is today.
Hello! Maybe you should use a different word choice to express your feelings. Some may find that word incredibly disturbing.
While everyone's opinion should be valued, your word choice shouldn't be, as the African American community has a history of oppression.

It would be really nice if you didn't use the re word, it has a lot of meaning and you are just throwing it around like nothing.
Your hateful racist comments are vile and you need your mouth washed out with soap.
This is not a way to calmly discuss your opinions
There is no reason to speak that way, using hate speech is really low class and you will not get any respect from people speaking that way.

Someone's race or nationality doesn't have any bearing on who they are as a person, and to use race as a slur shows more about you.
I understand the argument you are making, but I'd back off on the language because it takes away from you points.
I hear you and respect your opinion, but watch the language please.  It's offensive to many.
I recommend watching the language a bit because it is distracting from understanding you argument.
I understand your thinking, but I'd use a different word.  It really offends a lot of people now a days.

Generally, using hate speech to fight for freedom of speech is what drives people to be decisive in their opinions.
Bringing people's mental disabilities or physical features into a discussion takes away from the real topic being discussed.
Look at the other users wording, you can get your point across even better without using hateful words.
Either ignore the user or remove references to people's mental capacities when making an argument.
Keeping to the topic would be much more concise and easy for others to understand if you dropped all of the meaningless hate words.

Just because a person has a different life belief calling names in unhelpful in the situation.

I feel that there are better adjectives to describe how your feeling about the tree master piece, instead of using negative names.
There is no need for name calling at the end of your state. There are better was to make your point.

Wow. But I din't see an apartment number on there. Probably doesn't even live there.
I don't see anyone here but us. And I'm a white woman!
I don't understand how you are drawing a straight line to antisemitism from this tragic story.
Please try not to speak of women and race in such a manner. Its hurtful and doesn't help anything or anyone.
There is no reason to be responding with so much anger.
Please don't treat black people or disabled people this way.
Maybe you should get to know other black people and treat them as human beings.
I totally agree but no need to stoop to their level.
No need to throw out slurs.
Whoa just take it easy man. You can express yourself differently.
There are way better ways to express yourself than 5 offensive words stacked together.
Your comment does not reflect the ideals that you claim to support.
Posting inappropriate comments in reference to Matthew Richards does nothing to solve your problem with him.
Positivity a day keeps the hate away. A murder charge is no way to fix your issue.

Hate speech incites violence, both you and our society is better than that.
There are more accurate words to use, such as person or hairdresser.
While freedom of speech may be something you find important, there are more accurate descriptions that get at what your feelings are.

Have you ever met someone that identifies in this way? Take some time to think before you write / speak out against something you don't know

None of us can say we agree with Trump 100% of the time, but we can say that we need to respect him as our leader.
That is a lot of anger over a simple Halloween post.
Trump is always ahead of what we hear on the media. Do not be fooled by what we are told.
Trump is not a dictator at all. People must spend all day making this stuff up. All Obama did was ruin healthcare.
Bottom line is Kavanaugh was never guilty and I'm glad that's over with.

The insult was really not needed, you could have got your point across just fine without it.

Attacking someone's mental capacity isn't fair, you never know if they really suffer from something.

I'm sorry you have such a warped view on Jewish people.
There is no reason to use such language toward women of any kind
There is no reason to be using slurs towards white people
That's not proper to use such language
It's not nice to group all leftists into one group
No need to be so aggressive, those with down syndrome did not do you any wrong and it's not fair to use it as an insult
Unless you are referring to someone personally, no need to generalize and be so mean to the Jewish people
That's not very nice... unless you know him personally that's a lot of assumptions you are making
Unless you are referring to someone personally, there is no need to group all the Jewish people and insult them

Please eliminate the language that uses debasing words to express your beliefs.
Take out the offensive talk and use more edifying words please.

It's not necessary to use derogatory slang when you could just use the word 'person' instead.
Be thoughtful of those you might hurt using that word, those with mental disabilities shouldn't be unfairly brought into this.
Using negative undertones and hateful words isn't really a good way to get people to accept you.
You can disagree with someone without calling them names, it's mor effective if you leave those types of words out of the conversation.
Using words that demean someone's sex really takes away from the point you are trying to get across. More would agree without it.
Hi There, Please refrain from using derogatory comments. They are hurtful and do not reflect the views of most people here. Thanks

Name calling the person you disagree with isn't going to solve anything.
It is better to judge each person by their character, instead of stereotyping an entire race or religion.
Just because someone likes the same sex doesn't mean they are less than you.
Name calling someone you've never met isn't going to solve anything.
Name calling each other is not going to solve any problems.
Using words that attack someone's disability don't contribute to understanding.
Words that attack an entire race are neither careful, nor considerate.
I don't think using words that perpetuate a negative stereotype by race show care or promote understanding.
Calling a group by their proper name would help other people to better understand what you are saying.
Explaining why you don't like someone is more beneficial than using coded speech.
Truly poignant commentary. Bravo.
That's not even a clever way to sneak in a racial slur.
I don't know how many times it needs to be said: Using the n word DOESN'T MAKE YOU SOUND COOL.
"Tranny porn is unacceptable," says the person using hate speech.
perhaps you could reframe from using that word in the future

that is creative but very offensive please leave out that language
the colour of his skin should have not barely, leave out that language. thanks
that escalated quickly
i have no way to respond to this conversation
thats a lot of words for an educated man
i'm sure the you're the most popular lad in middle school
It doesn't make sense to hate an entire religion based on the actions of a few people.
Just because someone is a different race, doesn't mean they are less than you.
Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean they are less intelligent than you.
Just because someone is a different race, doesn't mean they don't have any feelings.
It doesn't make sense to name call someone that you've never even met.
Its inappropriate to use 'faggot' as its a direct attack to someone based on their sexual orientation.
Its inappropriate to use the word 'nigger' as its a direct attack to someone based on their race.

Once again, an example of the enlightened in America. Next time please back it up with evidence, and English.
I'm guessing that this gentleman was so incensed by your comment that he couldn't type it out. Sad, really. We'd like to hear you.
Perhaps you could describe your comment in more civil terms.
Your comments show how juvenile you are, and how frightened of woman you really are. Please try again.
I'm not gay, but on behalf of the gay community, don't be so homophobic.
There is no point in being derogatory or calling others names.
Come on, you know it's mean to compare people to those with real mental disabilities.
Just because you don't like someone's politics doesn't mean you need to speak in racist tones.
It's disgusting to refer to anyone, especially a baby, with a racist slur.
I would tell them that there is no need for name calling and you can win over people much easier with facts than that.
This language is ignorant and uncalled for. People deserve to be respected even if you don't agree with them. That is what I would tell them
There is a balance to the power that everyone is striving for and pointing the finger at any one gender or ethnicity isn't the answer.
I don't even know what they are talking about, therefore I can't help redirect it.
Just because you don't understand the reasoning behind other people's beliefs does not make their beliefs wrong.

Muslims have a proud and rich history and informed mch of the modern world, you should open your heart instead of being unkind.
If you understand how it feels to have your race attacked, then you can see why it is wrong for you to attack another race
You might seriously consider seeking mental help if you feel that way.
I'm not sure which side I'm on, but it seems to me that as intelligent people maybe we should abstain from name calling and hurtful words!
While not the most offensive posts, maybe we could all work on using better language to express our opinions!
Even people that don't know what they're talking about deserve respect; I don't think racial name calling is appropriate towards anyone!
It is sad that the victim went through such a horrible thing, but I believe that using hateful language does not help improve the situation!
I don't think racist comments are very intelligent and I feel like we would be better off as people if we refrained from ignorant language!
I understand your point, but watch the language a bit.  That word is quite offensive.
People are going to focus on your insensitive language instead of your points when you speak like that.
I believe we can all find more eloquent ways of expressing ourselves in our comments!
Ok, tell me how your really feel.  That word is disrespectful and not appropriate.

Leave out the sexism and racial slurs, and maybe I'd like this thread. Especially the last one. Everyone should take that course.

This comment made me laugh because it sounded so absurd, but in all seriousness I feel it'd be better not to insult others with our speech!
It's sad to me that racism is so prevalent everywhere and I believe it's our responsibility to guard our speech against hate and negativity!

I'm not sure how this relates, but perhaps we could abstain from hurtful speech towards others of different persuasions.
Argue your point without attacking someones ethnicity, that way even people like him may be able to see your side and agree with you.
Instead of insulting the mentally disabled, show how smart you are and cut out the access language.
Say she's wrong and explain why instead of referring to her sex, it's the best way to get a useful discussion going.
Just tell him why you think he's wrong, show how intelligent you are instead of how unintelligent you think someone else is.

Sad that people resort to speaking to each other in this manner!  We should be encouraging positivity, not spreading hateful speech!
I wish we could be more kind towards others!  I think we all should be treated equally and do not deserve to be called such awful names!
I don't think this is funny and neither would most of the people around you.
While violence is never ok, I don't believe aggressive name calling and racial slurs are the proper response to this situation!

You make a decent point, but your argument is diluted by your use of the offensive words.

Let's put down actions without homophobia. There's no reason we can't.
The Antisemitism doesn't need to be a part of this discussion. You can improve on that if you tried.

Diversity is what makes us great. Your comments sound a lot like a dog whistle.
As an Italian American I am more upset with your language than his love life. Racism has no place in our culture.
While horribly misspelled, your insult is both abhorrent and juvenile. I would advise finding a new one if you want to actually make a point

Speaking down on someone speaks volumes to one's character.
It's OK to show your pleasure and excitement without using sexual profanity.
Your statement is hard to read and it is distracting when you use harsh language.
Instead of yelling at someone directly who you don't agree with, just state your point and more people will take the time to read it.
Your choice or wording comes off as hurtful to people who really have mental development problems.
Talking about intolerance while displaying intolerance contradicts your statement and could be confusing to others.

Hi there, user 1! Let's try not using that kind of fowl language. There are other user's here and I'd hate for them to get the wrong idea.
I think both of you guys need to take a step back and think of the other person in this situation.
That may be your opinion, but that is absolutely unacceptable.
Let's realize that they are here to help us.
Your entitled to what you believe to be fact, fact of the matter is that we all have the right to vote and will get to again soon.
Hate speech against someone's entire race or religion is cheapening any actual point any of you were trying to make.
Disagree all you want but slurring the disabled is completely uncalled for.
Using hate speech against an entire race says more about you than it does them.
Attacking the disabled or an entire religion does not help further this conversation.

Some people's actions can be sad, but I think using hateful language in our comments is sad as well!  We are better than that!

If you don't agree with someone being abusive to women, there's no need to show scorn by implying he's gay.
You can have a decent argument without the use of a contemptuous term for gay.
Calling someone mentally r to prove your point makes you sounds childish.
There's absolutely no need to use this term. You're being blatantly racist.
Your opinion against Orange County would sound a lot more valid without the use of racial slurs.
You should think better than to use this word so casually.
Please don't spread these stereotypes, they're not based in facts.
I don't think that you should be proud of deepening your own biases.
Considering the tragedy I don't think that you should be most concerned about optics.

seems like the best thing to do is stay away from her to avoid any issues
You using a person's race as an insult only shows how narrow minded you are.
Mentally challenged individuals tend to be highly intelligent so to use that as a way to describe something as stupid is ignorant.
Using mental illness as a way to call something stupid is only showing of your lack of creativity
just another example of a minimalist
While I can certainly sympathise with the frustration of some people, I do not believe filthy, offensive, or rude speech is ever necessary!
I do not believe name calling shows a sign of intelligence or tact.  We need to be more aware of how our speech affects others around us!
Sad world when hate and ignorance take over!  We need to be defending and helping those in trouble, not degrading and shaming them!
In spite of this being debunked it still isn't kind or polite to use hurtful name calling!  There are better ways to use our words!
"Rational reasons to hate" sounds logical but also dangerous when "rational" is defined by the one speaking and the one listening.
Use of hateful language regarding religion is unwarranted and unintelligent.
No need to insult people with a disability while expressing an opinion.

I'm sorry you have such a warped view on Muslims
I'm sorry you have such a warped view on African-Americans.
I agree that it is our right to stand up for ourselves, but we should also aspire to use better words and language in our statements!
Believe me, I understand you point.  I'd back on on the strong language though because it will steer people away from your argument.
I totally agree with your argument, but watch that word usage if your would.  It diverts attention to you instead of the point your making.
I certainly understand that you're upset, but watch some of that language.  It's quite offensive to many.
Your language is taking away from your argument.  Instead of me agreeing with your point, I focus on the words themselves.

Even if you don't agree with the news article, you have no evidence that it's being done by a Jewish person.

Even if you don't agree with her, there's no need to call her retarded.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion.
I would like to see the statistics and your sources behind your statement about black men raping white women.
Even if you don't agree with the candidate, there is no need for such language to refer to him or any other race.
I wasn't really thrilled with the meeting of those two myself, but I don't think we need to use hateful names towards them!
Perhaps we can find better ways of expressing ourselves, sans name-calling and hateful speech!
I really cannot agree with this statement and I believe there has to be nicer ways to get our points across!
This comment confused me; maybe your posts would be more readily accepted if the language was cleaned up a little!
I think violent crimes against anyone is wrong, and I also think we need to find ways to communicate without all the hateful language!
Misogynistic hatred as evidenced here constitutes hate speech, which is forbidden here. Thank you for your help in keeping hate away.

Criticism is much better taken if it's constructive and polite!
Just because someone is different then you does not mean you should call them names.
This language is not called for and you would more apt to continue the conversation without it.
You should just say some girl and not refer to her negatively.
You know you could state your reasons without bashing another's race, religion, or gender.
You don't have to stereotype a person because they look different then you.
It would be easier to just say you do not like leftism or conservatism, instead of using all the negative words.
Even though someone ruins it for others doesn't make it okay to be negative.

You really shouldn't use that word so freely, I know what you mean and all but it can be offensive, especially to those with mental handicap
There is not a need to such language to in these post. Slandering someone with racial slurs seem pointless.

Calling someone that isn't necessary to prove your point.
Using characteristics that people don't choose isn't relevant in today's society. It's wrong and unnecessary.
Someone's characteristics should not be insulted. Its not right and is completely irrelevant.
Calling someone names isn't necessary to prove your point.
2, 3  Putting it that way shifts people to race issues rather than the one currently being discussed.
2, This type of commentary is unnecessary, and does not contribute to the discussion an any way.  Stop.
2, Why would people were educated liberal thinkers for their time want to fight over cultural shifts that happened over the course of time?
Interesting how using so many slurs renders a statement irrelevant.
2, Thank you for providing a demonstration of stupidity for us all, so next how do we best deal with this hate speech and get real work done
Racism, and the "n word," since it offends many, has no place in intelligent commentary. Help us put down the brake when it comes to hate!
Using the term "c---" pejoratively is offensive and should be avoided.
"Ret---ed" as used here may offend the mentally disabled and their families; it should be avoided.
The term "fa--ot" comprises homophobic hate, and as such is not permitted here. So let's make a date to stamp out hate!

You need to stop talking about women that way, especially total strangers.
Please take care in your terminology, this is a hate speech free platform. First and final warning. Thank you for your understanding.
Your post makes no sense and is racially offensive.
All of the use of these words is offensive and mocks disabled people.
That word doesn't mean stupid, it is a serious medical condition.
I agree with your argument but could do without the homophobic slur.
Each person is different. It is better to judge someone on their character, rather than their race or religion.
On top of being incredibly racist, this statement is outdated. Minorities have more representation now than ever in this countries history.
I completely agree with your opinion, but using hateful language will only assure that no one actually listens to what you are saying.
There are a million different words to call someone that disagrees with you, your choices here do not reflect well on your intellect.
No one is ever going to listen to your opinions if you feel the need to bulk them up with derogatory words for shock value. It's cheap.
Totally unnecessary to hatefully insult women while expressing opinion.

Look at a calendar, it's tie to stop using that word like that.
Using that word disparages innocent, disabled people.
There's no point in you writing that, only to be offensive. No one is impressed.
Advocating for racial extermination is deplorable. You need to feel shame..
The vulgar language used here lacks to make a valid point.
There are many more appropriate words that should be used to replace the foul language.
Using this type of language to speak about a woman shows what type of person one is.
Replacing the foul language with more appropriate words would make it easier for others ro read the post.
Talking down to others because of their race or sexual orientation speaks volumes to one's character.
A person should not be degraded due to their political beliefs.
Clearly the idea of hatred can spurn unnecessary attacks that would be better left unsaid.
The act of getting pregnant is a matter to be taken with respect and dignity for the mother and not a slanderous attack.
There is no need for slanderous attacks when dealing with politics.
Political beliefs have no place in whether or not laws are enforced and saying so further separates us as people.
Slow down and think before you post. Calling someone names and insulting others does not help you prove your point. It does the opposite.
You can find a better adjective to describe this potential situation, such as "disfigured." Find a more accurate, kinder adjective.
You can use a better word to describe the people your are talking about. What you said is rude and limits potential responses to your post.
Even if you meant this literally, there are better ways to describe this. Not only is it mean, but it does not explain why you feel this way
This comment has no meaning and does not even tell what you are talking about. Slow down and explain. Do not jump to insults.

I find this discussion useless. There is no point to it except to set people upon each other.
LOL you guys make me laugh. it's just that in polite society, one does not use those words.
Well, all's well that ends well. Glad he left.
Just because someone is a different race, doesn't mean they are a bad person.
It doesn't make sense to hate an entire race based on the actions of a few people.
Name calling someone you've never even met isn't going to solve anything.

Using words that are offensive to race and sexual preference are not tolerate anymore. People have to be empathetic.
Using profanity and then attacking someone based on their choice of sexuality is never wise. It's better to use wiser words.
Words that attack intellect can be offensive to someone who may have a family member with true problems.
Automatically playing out the race card creates contentions and then using racial slurs creates more problems. It is best to avoid that.
Racial slurs create more problems and are never politically correct.
There's no statistical evidence to support your racially-biased statement. You're only preaching hatred.
It's wrong to put the blame of an issue on an entire racial group. In addition, using slurs for mental disability is in poor taste.
If these allegations are true, then Mr. Booker should go to prison. Regardless, it's wrong to condemn a race due to one man's actions.
Your use of slurs for a female homosexual have nothing to do with the previous conversation on animals.
If this person is harassing you by creating other accounts, you should report him, instead of using slurs for mental disability.

I know you feel rejected but that doesn't mean there is something wrong with her - no need for name calling!
Aside from being incoherent, I doubt you can say that a different way without being insulting toward women.

I can't believe it's 2019 and there's still people backward enough to insult an entire race with such an offensive term. People suck.
There's no reason to offend homosexuals because you disagree with the actions of one person.
There are just no words to express how unacceptable your hateful words are. I hope one day you're half the man he was.
I would think that most gays are in fact happy
Very rude and unnecessary. How would you feel if someone were calling you those names?
You did not have to use those hateful words in your reply. What is wrong with you
You can express how you feel without all the hatred in your context. Retaliating with hate just makes the situation worse.
This is 2019! You really need to stop with all the hate. We are all the same on the inside. You need therapy
It is very difficult to take you serious because of your poor choice of words.
it would be easier to make your point without usig words that will turn people away.
Although you may have a very valid point, your choice of words is disheartening,
This quotes would be much more interesting with a less offensive choice of words.
Using demeaning and unthoughtful language is not the best way to get your message across.
This debate was going well until foul language and racist words were used.
While you are expressing your feelings and we all hear you you are also using language that stops your true message dead in its tracks.
There are many words in the English language to get your point across without doing what you have done here.
Whoa! There are many other ways to express your feelings without using racist remarks and name calling.
Both of you just do us all a favor, delete these hateful posts and don't ever do it again.
being hung by your own tongue, which means if a crime happens that you have talked you can be found guilty because of what you've said
i understand you are passionate about this issue but pretty sure it can be addressed in words that aren't so offensive
While I'm almost positive you are joking about the 10% causing an issue I think it might not seem very funny to some people
not sure if y'all are just goofing with the slurs but just thought I call it to your attention that some might be offended by it
where'd the bacon and eggs part of the conversation come, but I look at it like if someone doesn't like a food I like then more for me
It's a real shame that we cannot have an intelligent conversation without bringing in the offensive language.
It's fine to have your opinion, but there is no reason to use language like that to make your point.
Thanks for joining in the conversation.  Maybe you can lose the foul language and just state your opinion.
I hope you know that the foul language doesn't help to make your point any stronger.  Maybe you should just stick to the facts.
There are some facts here that can be discussed, but they are getting lost in all of the name calling and racist talk.
Whoa, User 2. That's a bit harsh, don't you think? What does that have to do with anything.
User 1, you can get your point across without being racist and ableist.
Slow your roll, User 2. That's not necessary to use those kinds of insults.
Pretty sure your racist ramblings totally invalidate your point.
Wow, way to steer the conversation directly into insane racism.
This slur is unacceptable in our discussion because it is hurtful and offensive to gays.
This use of the n-word is unacceptable in our discussion because it is hurtful and offensive to blacks.
This use of the slurs is unacceptable in our discussion because it is hurtful and offensive to the other.
This use of the n-word and hatred is unacceptable in our discussion because it is hurtful and offensive to blacks.
This use of the r-word is unacceptable in our discussion because it is hurtful and offensive to people with mental disabilities.
It's hard to take your argument seriously when you use language like that.
When you use slurs, it reflects poorly on you and the point you want to make.
The use of that word makes me not want to listen to your opinion.
Your argument would be much more convincing if you didn't use those types of slurs.
It's difficult to understand your argument when you use a word like that.
Using racial slurs doesn't help anyone get their point across.
Threatening racially motivated attacks and using racial slurs are not a good way to get your point across.
Using racial slurs doesn't make it any easier to understand your point.
Using ableist slurs is ignorant and doesn't help further any point you're trying to make.
That's a racist accusation
That's offensive towards women
Don't use that word to describe the mentally challenged
Even when you are angry you can use better language.
I realize you are angry. Let's try to keep the language coherent though.
There are other words you could be using to get your point across.
There are better ways to express your disagreement. Find them.
Talking politics is fine, Use different language to express yourselves.
Your rhetoric language needs to change. Try adult words.
Keep your language civil. No need to be so aggressive in your speech.
There is no need for this kind of speech. Be a little less trivial in your descriptions of people.
Stupid or Dumb would suffice in this conversation.
You are showing your ignorance with your language. Try to class it up.
I'm sure that you can find a better and less offensive way to communicate your point of view.
I'm not sure what you mean by that, but it sounds really hateful.
This is a thread about a hate crime that utilizes hate language. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
Your hate towards anyone you don't agree with is alarming.
I don't agree with her either, but that description is unnecessary.
Your message is lost when you use hate speech.  It gives people an excuse to ignore you.
Rape is not related to a person's melanin content.  Rape is caused by rapists.
It ends up in popular because of a complex algorithm that correlates views with popularity. And people seem to really like it.
Considering that he has more money that you or I will ever see in our lifetime, he can't be that dumb and his melanin content is moot.
You may demand, but because you don't know how to ask for things, all you can do is demand like a child.  with no satisfaction.

For all your eloquent turns of street lingo, the use of slurs for mental disabilities brings your own intelligence into question.
I tend to think that those who lower themselves to racial slurs are truly the ones equatable to  feces.
If you believe that all members of the Dem Party have a mental disability, then you need to spend more time you need to raise money to help!
The article NOWHERE mentions that the attacker was Muslim, which makes both you and your point ignorant.
The very fact that you assumed he was a certain race and decided to use a slur shows your ignorance and that you should be censored.
Downgrading people is not a good way to express your opinion.
Derogatory comments are not needed here.
Your anger can be expressed in a better way, Try different language.
Violent language is not needed. Try expressing your thoughts coherently.
Name calling someone with different beliefs doesn't solve any problems.
just because someone likes the opposite sex doesn't mean they are a bad person.
Just because someone has a different opinion than you doesn't mean yours is more valid.
Name calling a person you don't like doesn't solve any problems.
Just because someone is a different race, doesn't make them less than you.
I think you can dislike a candidate without bringing their race into it, if what they did is true than focus on that.
Your opinion is fine, but it's better to not generalize an entire group of people.
Using a better choice of words will allow you to continue expressing your opinion without getting banned on other platforms.
I would use another word instead, not everyone with intellectual disabilities is necessarily dumb.
People would be more likely to respond to your question if you dropped the characteristics, let people respond based on their policies.
That's one hell of the generalization. If you go buy it, most of countries would end up under dictator's boot.
Your insult spewing is completely off topic.
Your insult repeating leads only to conclusion you have nothing on topic to say. Better keep out of it then.
Mindless insults, you ought to be banned.
The language you used is indeed harsh and just completely unnecessary. You need to learn how to be more kinder and aware of your words.
The word choice you have used is incredibly offensive to the disabled community, and you should think about your word choices in the future.
The words you have used are not ideal for the conversation. You insulted a whole community of people as well as an entire religion.
There is no point in using such harsh language! This makes you look insensitive and incredibly racist.
I understand the context of what you were saying, but there was no reason to use such an offensive term. This hurts an entire community.
I can't decipher your argument though all the name calling.
Do not use slurs to indicate you think someone is stupid.
Do not attack people with arbitrary and improvable ad hominems.
I agree, he should be retiring soon given his age.
Be civil and do not name call. There has to be a more substantive response than that.
Faggot is an offensive word and shouldnt be used to describe anyone. It is an insult to the homosexuals and therefore, refrain from using it
Use of stereotypes against Muslims and Jews is wrong. Also, its inappropriate to call an homosexual person a faggot
Negro, Nigger, and Retard are offensive words since they attack people based on their skin colour and mental health
That type of language fuels religious and racial hatred; please do not use it.
Please do not use racist language; stereotyping all members of a particular group is wrong.
Please do not use homophobic expressions.
Using this language is offensive to large groups of people and unacceptable.
Use of the n-word is never acceptable as is is too course for all discourse and offensive to African-Americans.
This word is no longer acceptable in any conversation.
This over-the-top rhetoric has no place in any decent society as it offends most reasonable people.
There is no room for the insinuations that there is something wrong with a person's belief or mental ability as in this discussion.
Race shouldn't have to do with crime. If someone is a bad person then they just are... You cannot generalize one race on crimes.
Would you like it if someone piss and shit on your ancestor's grave? Think about what you're saying before you say it.
Race does not have anything to do with crimes committed. Evil people will always do evil things. You cannot generalize race on actions.
Mentally challenged individuals tend to be highly intelligent so to use that as a way to describe something as stupid is ignorant.
You using a person's race as an insult only shows how narrow minded you are.
To define someone by their race shows your narrow mindedness as people act out of their perceived norms all the time
To use sexuality as a means of insulting people is only showing of your lack of creativity.
You using a sexuality race as an insult only shows how narrow minded you are.
Relax and try to release the hate and put forth a logical statement that doesn't make you look ignorant.
I assume that since you are comparing Dems to the mentally challenged, you obviously have something against the mentally disabled.
You must have a lot of fear of women to need to reduce them to the one body part you can't figure out how to work.
You must need a reductionist view of people that are different than you to minimize the fear.

It doesn't make sense to hate a whole race based on the actions of a few people.
This is unreadable, except for racism...
Just because someone is a different race than you doesn't mean they are less than you.
It doesn't make any sense to hate an entire religion based on the actions of a few people.
Well unfortunately some Christians have had abortions and feel guilty. So I wouldn't be so tough on your stance for each religion.
Hate is one of the biggest feminist worries. I see it is still alive and well in this post.
Personally I have a 4 year degree, cannot find a job, and I'm disabled. So that SS check is the only thing I have!

there are different ways that you could have gone about saying this.
Must you call someone derogatory names like that? It's okay to dislike someone but you don't have to express it as such
or maybe look at some diferent words to use to describe him
that would mean that they are smart which they are not
i guess i could ask you what you have ever invented.
Please don't compare this user to a retarded three year old as that's not even an accurate comparison.

Rating musical talent with sexual preference really makes you an expert I suppose...
Random sexism.

I am not sure what you are even trying to say.
This does not add to the conversation.
You can say the same thing without using that language.
You are adding nothing to this conversation.
Using language like this makes hate spread further causing more tension. Please think what you are representing before posting hate.

Vulgarities don't really add any strength to an argument. They instead make one look uneducated. Maybe we could try more descriptive words.

Mentally challenged individuals tend to be highly intelligent so to use that as a way to describe something as stupid is ignorant.
This is exactly the kind of hate speech that is limiting.

There is a lot of hate in your messages, if no one is sure then you should keep comments to yourselfs and stop offending others.
The word cunt is disrespectful, you can express your opinion just dont use that kind of vocabulary.
Both of you should stop it, we need to respect others if we want our society to work.
Religion shouldn’t be a category that is attacked or demeaned.  Focus on the objectionable behavior, not who someone is.
Race should never be used as an insult.  It’s wrong and it detracts from any other argument you are presenting.

Just because someone is a different race, doesn't mean they are a bad person.

Sounds like you have a lot of pent up anger, ever though of taking up boxing?
You can find a better way to voice your displeasure. You don't have to mean to a entire race of people.
That seems uncalled for. Have more respect.
Wow, do you both really have nothing better to do then hate on each other? Such a shame and waste of great people.

Using such foul language to describe a woman speaks volumes about one's character.
Using vulgar language can make others think you have a lack of a good vocabulary.

Name calling leads to nothing more than pointless arguments.
Uncalled for. Haven't you heard of not judging a book by it's cover, maybe you should apply that to random people you don't know.
Everything about this is just terrible. Mistakes were made, don't hold that against other people. Dare to be the bigger person.
You're contradicting yourself here, a woman is still a woman and if you're against hitting them that applies to all.
You're right, he did a stupid thing. There is no need to call him names on top of it.

It isn't necessary to label someone's sexuality that you do not know.
Hey, don't say things like that, there's no need for that kind of language, simply saying "at least one person" would have been fine.
Everyone is entitled to their opinions, there is no need to insult someone based on their political affiliation.
Using a derogatory term for someones sexual orientation is uncalled for, it's 2019, we have no place for such terms, so I suggest you stop.
Disability is not something anyone should be made fun of or demeaned about.
