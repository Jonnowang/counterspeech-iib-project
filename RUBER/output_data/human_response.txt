I doubt she would want you to touch her. She has someone who loves her for who she is, and calling a group unclean won't change that.
Using words like that about women only make you seem like the bad guy.
Calling news channels words like that makes you look worse than what you're against. If you're polite, your points are much better made.
The great thing about the Western world is we accept other cultures and integrate them to adapt them to us, as long as we don't insult them.

That was completely uncalled for, people might actually respect you if you didn't speak with such vile words.
Someone might actually look at your page if you stopped using such vile language.
It would be great if you stopped using the re word, it is a terrible word and there are plenty of things you could use instead.
Both of you are vile for speaking like this about another human being, you have no heart and should be ashamed of yourself.

We need to stop hating entire groups for things they cannot help, because you in your prejudice is what creates many of these problems.
No one is actually owned, I think there is a better way to say this than with racist remarks.

Violence is found in every race, maybe we should focus more on mental health issues than peoples' races and feeding this hatred.
We should really be focused more on talking to each other without using derogatory terms for things people can't help, as if they are bad.

It would be nice if we could not call names on the internet.
