[text]: Ive already been in one of those situations. A nigger bitch chimped out at the grocery store accusing a White cashier of overcharging her. A nigger cashier showed her there was no error but that didn't stop her. She picked up her tote bag full of canned goods and ran around the store screaming racial insults and hitting every YT she could find with it. I got hit in the back. Nobody called the cops, or filmed her much less stop her, and she eventually left. She would never have tried it if she didn't know she'd get away with it.

[text]: To my fellow Catholics,   I'm Byzantine Catholic, my wife Roman Catholic. While I have perused the media for instances in other religions of sexual abuse, it seems to be the most widespread in Catholicism, perhaps with a near following amount of sex abuse cases occurring in Judaism, but attorney generals named "Shapiro" are willing to overlook Jewish communities with 50% or more of male children being molested in order to pursue 70 year old cases in the Catholic church. Imagine that.   But another bias has come to my attention. This is of homosexuals in the Catholic church, priests, bishops, cardinals, and maybe the Pope, having bias against Republicans and Conservatives. It seems we don't know what we thought we knew about our religion. Cardinal McCarrick, the homosexual that is ...
be evil.   Cardinal Vigano talks at length how homosexuals destroyed the church, don't let the influence of the church destroy America, vote Republican, and for 2020, vote Republican and for Trump.

[text]: Ben Shitpiro the controlled opposition CUCK and Never Trumper NEOCON JEW FAGGOT thinks that anyone who uses common sense is "deranged". Why does anyone follow this little beta weasel bitch???    A bunch of fake conservatives as well as virtue signalling normies who call themselves Republicans are attacking people like Candace Owens for stating the OBVIOUS, that this is a FALSE FLAG created by the Deep State criminal Cabal to get a sympathy vote, and to also make it look like our side are the ones who are violent. I'm attacking anyone on Twatter who calls themselves a conservative yet virtue signals to the left  by making fun of people that do research and ask questions or what they call "conspiracy theorists". Too bad I have to go to work now and have no time...

It isn't noble -- it's as retarded as the people throwing dirt about the past! There isn't a single great man in history that NEVER did anything wrong... Unless you try to throw Jesus or other religious figures surround by mythos into the mix -- AND EVEN THEN -- you still have droves of folks that will "find the straw in their eye (while having a wooden beam in their own)." They would probably lose their minds that I said straw... Who cares what butthurt idiots think about you? Seriously, just stop worrying about it and reject their sideways programming. We are lowering ourselves to position lower than butthurt idiots -- this ...
Neither Jesus nor any of the saints would approve, nor would any of the great men of history...   "You have enemies, good, that means you at least stood for something in your life." ~Churchill

[text]: OMG lol, I just caught the fucking #Juden in one fucking humongous ass fucking lie. This makes me question the whole entire DNA bullshit, especially in 23andMe. My first cousin from my mother's side, not my dad's side just connected with me in 23andMe. According to his results, my mom's side is 100% European while according to my results everything that is not European is descending from my mom's side. So my dad's side makes me 50% European while my mom's side is questionable. Now listen to this my cousin, on the other hand, is a lot more European than I am and his mother's side (My aunt - mother's sister) is 100% European. How can this be? If my mother and his mother were sisters then shouldn't both be 100% European? You #Jews just fucked up big time and I am calling you out on this. If ...
I cannot trust anything you do! Fuck you and your DNA bullshit, you have just proven to me that your knowledge about DNA is just as shallow as your knowledge of economics. Oh, I know how you rob us!

[text]: I'd rather have them not "assimilate". Hispanics intermarry at 50% with whites, and their children typically identify as white, which sullies our gene pool with African and Indian genes.   Up to this point American whites have been relatively pure (to the tune of 99%), even in southern states where the negro population exceeds 20%. Why ruin a good thing?

I should add that, I grew up in Virginia back in the 60's, and some of my best friends were Black, but when Blacks start looting stores during a disaster, like the recent flood, then they become niggers!

[text]: The only way to remedy the jewish problem in the long term is to wake up as many people as possible.  A guy going out and killing jews makes it harder to wake normies up. Society as a whole must deal with the jews... and vigilantism will only impede achievement of the societal mass-awakening.   If anyone who is woke to the jews can honestly say that upon their initial awakening, that unilateral action did not cross their mind, comment here, and I will call you a liar.      We are dealing with the most genocidal, evil, deceptive group of people to ever live, and some people who wake up to their evil just cannot bear the pain that comes with being awake before a critical mass of the population is awake.   If you feel like hurting jews, JUST GO OUT AND NAME THE JEW instead.
[eval_labels]: So what is your evidence and reasoning for thinking this about the jews?

Look at the way niggers parent their sprogs.

Orwell’s Animal Farm   By 2018, the reading and writing classes were becoming so easy since language had been surreptitiously reduced to less difficult words through political correctness that the animals were free to think openly as much as they could because really, nobody could think.  Many large words were memorized even though the ability and comprehension of such words were becoming more troublesome.  Big words yes, complete sentences no.   As for the commie pigs, they could still read and write perfectly ...

You literally spent YEARS on that pitiful echo chamber of a blog of yours, blaming the Northern states and everyone in them, for all the problems that afflict your pile of nigger shit of a region. Now that the reality has set in — that the political and racial demographics of the South are past the point of no return — you have the nerve to claim allies in the very place from which you want political separation. FUCK you, you two-faced, prescription-drug-addled fraud. I WIPE MY COCK with your Confederate loser flag.

[text]: Andrew Interrupted commented on your post.6 minutes: "Creating a Communist Utopia"   Andrew Interrupted @WubaGuba  1 Reply · Repost · Quote · a minute ago   Captain Bob @Captainbob   Yes, this is even better, Commies shooting beautiful unarmed women. Big brave men. Don't think for a minute that today's green haired Dyke slugs wouldn't do the same to us and our wives and children now if given the chance. We have EVERYTHING against us but somehow we must overcome through wit and wile and defeat these Commies or it's over. Now is the time for words and ideas, act now before things get very much worse. Strength in numbers.

[text]: @Jessicatarlov   I'm not quite sure how many times I have to tell your stupid moronic idiotic brainless twat waffle self you don't speak for women whether it's Republican women or Independent Women because I'm going to tell you something you little tart I have women that are independent as friends they don't like anybody speaking for them let alone some democratic dingbat who doesn't know any of them. Here's another clue for you you bimbo constantly running to the polls and saying but the poll say this the polls say that we have the advantage in the generic poll, Hillary Clinton also had a lead in all the polls didn't she? Everyone knows that they oversample Democrats in order to get the desired outcome they want it's been well documented perhaps you should look it up instead of ...
only thing I wish is that Dagan would get up and punch you off the fucking couch. Stop speaking for women cuz you don't speak for me and you don't speak for any other woman you disgusting dirty bitch
