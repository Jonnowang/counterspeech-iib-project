This kind words do no make us feel welcome as redditors or members of homosexual community so they are lessened, try better responses next time. 2 Day ban. Fight me irl ifyoudidn'tlikeit2
Name calling just creates pointless arguments that never bring actual facts into it, grow up, you are no way near a child
Use of hateful language regarding race here isn't welcome or tolerated.
Using terms for womans sexual parts is very sexist, please do not do it
It doesn't make sense to wish that one race (hispancic or others) had failed you, and for others, based on the successes of others to have come before them.  And there would no way for a group of people, especially hispanic peoplke for Hispanics "in" in your comment, to know that, anyway. It sounds an lot racial supremacist. Which you don't  even use in correct syntax (.", and so), because your grammar blabes. Not smart. Ne'ermindz
In this era of information asympthopathy and the ever evolving English lament are better terms
Just saying that they are Muslim is justifying their reaction to you.  Try using other ethnocity's
Please take the rude language else Wonder Woman12
You need to look up who Lil Wayne is and then think a long before throwing around that word for no good reason.  That statement really is offensive to multiple groups of people.
Such hate wow
Wow it sure feels good to not be racist like they are! They are humans just like everyone around us who should be protected justlike we are
There's needs to be a bit more sensitivity regarding language associated with the community.  I feel a report would suffice when it is needed and is accompanied by a message to the poster. Any other actions have unwilling consequences... Thanks :)
Racial insensus doesnot exist today only stained glass shows racial division  and inert. It is us who keep ourselves in conflict.
I'd like for you have a deep think about that smile. Who are you to talk that way about anyone
The usage of the f'a'tag here is offensive in and on itself; consider other words when communicating on a platform of choice.
I agree the leftists, and liberal are not what you believe they are.  But this psycholoogy can help destroy more innocent liberty then these "douchba-- g's!"
That is one hell of a way not to be understood, I'm positive with a lot less name calling you can find ways to communicate just fine. Cheering yourself on doesn't do the real pain and harm in my opinion. We all struggle with pain, learn and overcome together
It would appear some do consider themselves in debt to "The White Man", who have used us both as vessels.
Just...just never say that
I'm sorry you feel they are responsible, though I would say that you should try reaching those you respect at those organizations who might differing from your assessment
I don't believe racial hate words have a benefit in the conversation and do nothing lessening hate and violence. We needless put ourselves in a place with hatred
Just make your comment to abso-fuckening-lllly express how YOU feel, rather saying hate shit that has nothing whatsoever going to add value here...go find other platforms for hater.
Just outright attacking someone based of their religious affiliation or sexual orientation is no better than the trash talking going  on here
Use of the c|ck and r(d), etc. here is unacceptable in discourse as it demeans and insults women.
Please do not use terms that discriminate based on mental impedance or ability. Raciciussm isnt' enough here
The R rating for violence is sufficient, no real-world impact required here.
Hey! Those of us in the working girls' group have plenty to do and deserve you giving respect the deserved
There, there little boy, it`ll be al right. Lets talk when its all said and done. No one cares what an unoriginal homo says
This language (using "f-n-z?"), which denigritises gay-ness — and here the use of the "+got" word to describe someone having many lo friends - is derogotory – are banned―and shall be consternated in here . ,,Live Long And Prosper.�  From our FAQs . Thanks ―
Hi troll account 6, this has no power over you, don't fall for their b.s, don't comment and keep going. thanks :)
To get such details from a hypotheticle you must admit you fear homosexuals to make yourself less than equal
There needs to exist less hatre speech and more empathizaion in our political lifess.
Hurting more minorly/nonwhite people doesn't help anyone. Addressing him one on one helps.
Name calling the person you disagree with isn't goingto accomplish a a lot..
I hope in the next few hundred years we can move past this ideaology that men are superior, as all of us come from wahmen who were once wahmen
There it is! You racionalizing people being mean. I get that this isny right but grow and deal with it like we're meant too.
Use of the slurs here is not warrante. Lets leave it here.
Name calling based on sex can make everyone angry. Prior to having such names flicked at other politicians should consider other people views and choose better words. :)
Hey there, xenophobic Slurs are offensive and hurtfuland should not be used. Please use less than those 3 colors mentioned, ty in my book .
We are supposed to take each others statements on faith because neither one of us ever saw and neither one should trust anyone ever because evidence isn't a thing that ever exists because everyone's an out of work actor or some sorta bullshit like the truth just biz mane.
You should try and improve yourself before looking down on others for something as meaningfully little as their body size or race.
Making insulting refererenCes doesnt have a place.  It just keeps it going when were winning and doesnt come from winning love.
Use of the slur here is unacceptable in our discourse as it demeans and insults gays.
This is an intense reaction with a big word odngo, there perhaps some self reflection going on...
Useof the n-word is unacceptable in we live In our own discredito
I'm fairly well informed but I find you very offensive because if you're beliefs.
Your opinion would mean sooooooo much more if you didn't throw hatey speech on behind it. I feel you might be surprised to learn just exactly how dumb and hate laden what was just spoken here! You're better
There should've been two black presidenta in history. It just happened that one died recently!
It'd be good not to throw around terms derogorrantly, I'd hope? Help to reaffirment one's perspective instead of alienation!
Using words that directly attack a medical condition aren't productive nor matching our standards anymore
Whenever someone has a different, yet relevant opinion, you may want to back off the thrust of what you say to keep things friendly. Calls are cheaper. :)
Your comment can just as well be left alone, no action being taking
Main St. Apex, in front of Roy Chuck, is predominately Venezuallano-Romani. The two individuals that were beaten are members of Villa Salsana - they even have a video of their "prank call," on FB. Racially sensitive? Yes. Profiling in T.L.P? I would call a maybe... but I wouldn't jump down someone on the assumption it is. Cheers!!! Edit* Adding info. and more stuff. Ty!!!
I totally agree, and as a vegan, all I think your statement should contain is Veg*inism (since its plant based and ethic-only), or Veg-dietism for inclusive Vegxianists. 😉 Thank you and great conversaion 🙂
You don't have any of those DNA, so no way you can tell what it is, either.
This footage isn't really doing justice to the actual crime; there must have been a lot more wrong done as it resulted in what looks like such horrible action
It takes some major balls to state a controversial topic without using any form of harmful slurs :) Kudos, I appease the hatered
User 3 must be your mother. Your account has been temporarily suspended. Enough violation can warrant a permanent ban. 1st Time Mainstaging.
The foul language, lack of any kind actual point being, the insult, name calling all make an already ridiculous post seem much stoopid. Try again.
Please elimate the negative sounding language. Thanks
Your comment is both offensive AND inaccurate. Just no sense trying to comment like it is. Language is dead anyways. All we get now are cat memes.
Please explain exactly where in the text you were complEted by this quote  I'll try with a more appropriate word  Name calling isn'r a good look'a to start your commenta. Try another word  Please and again with the more appropriate choiceofwording '
Hear, hear.
These terms are really upsetting and derangering to Americans of all races and religion, please refrain from using these harmful and derrogatory terms for everyone
Please don t comment such thing. You wouldn't like  seeing yourself as that. Let go by yourself the negation language.
The term is vulva-bland and not required to be demeening of anyone's sexual choices.
Your racial slurs do the "Whitter'n'speak" leg work of putting down whiste-ers on social media sites. They dont make a statement they make an insult!
Your argument is sound until your attack someone's gender by name checking.
Please review the rule 4 policies. Factually derogatory comments will not pass and language attacks will not survive first ban. We understand you are frustrated but take care please and good morning to everyone . Thank you
It does not add to your comment or any others by using language to insult the poster you're commentary regarding and also to show your ignorance to different political opinions when using homophobic slurs and false beliefs of your fellow liberals on the subject please stop
Another violent person needs their emotions under wraps by not expressing anything except hatred and vile. Stupid people always use words wrong lololz
Lena Dunam confronts them much better without using gender slurs
That phrase really has very little meaning left, put it that way! Use a much more appropriate one
Using hateful terminology towards people with disablities isnlt necassary or correct
Your point is hindered with the negative terms used for people with handicAPDS. Please refrain in the future.
"Redneck..." as pejorative.......
I get what you're saying but saying it in English would sound better. Somehow the way women should been hurt through this isn"t coming through very well
When discuss women make careful considerations as to when it would be in best interest if such slurs didn't accidentally enter the text
There is no need to describe people with a mental disability in an unfightfully mocking or demeaning way.
In spews guts; please clean it up.
This is hate speech and completely inellgable here. Please avoid its use  Thank you
Please refrain from that use of language it harms alot Of peoples reputitions and lifestyles.  Thank
I don't see any outage or problem; I only seem concerned for those with tragiced heads and family looking at missing people.
You guys really could have chosen any other ad hominem to try... what are kids really good in this game??!
It won't be very long until you are in one of those videos. Then you may see it from an others point. Homie
There were other band options that he choose that one he could have chosen that donnot equate with violence toward LGBT. Just because you're in the club does it mean that they deserve hatred for your liking.
That phrase only really gets a pass when we're explicitely referecing The Cinema Snobs.
Raisin head has nothing to do jew the argument or anything other say shut you fucking mouth you worthless piece pile o shit human I would punch for free since your broke ass can pay your bails to come fuck with people again stop responding if this happens again I will have more posts to delete to free me and I have more time for you fucking p.o.S' s go jump. Off you piece of fucking shit come at me bro
There's no point in this. You're not winning any arguments, he's clearly angry. Let them come here when they're less stoopid and hateful. There are way more pleasantly conversatory groups elsewhere to take it out if ya want 🤓
Please refer to a person with disable as you would anyone else in terms of grace, class., decency, and intelligence.
I would just ignore the memes you don't want and enjoy the race or sports event if your favorite. :}
You could make the same point about the religious and anti-familial bigs without adding "man of race..?" at the beginning of the thought or using hate words.
Uses offensive term then backtracks, nice dude not funny.
Please refrain, language attacking females is not tolerated
Using words that profanely refer to any specific category of People, based in ignorance, deserve less tolerant responses.
Just like how it is okay for individuals of every religion and ethnic heritage To Emerge and participate together - equally so should intelligent dialogue And practices be celebrate across the board
Just make your argument without hateful comments or name- calling.
If they're so slow, maybe leave it alone and just never comment again. You can leave easily if all else fails, I mean you obviously don't get any action.
Please be civil. Do you have to resort to this type of behavior on every level or is it more a spat between people you don't respect at life's work? I can see an argument for either scenario. Help help me solve this...?
There is zero point in using such hate speech you're guaranteed to never encounter and is flat out morale destroying for others reading your post please find some more intelligent way of making you  case.
There you have it guys, a perfect representation! Nothing to read too deep into... Just hate and ignorance! Hooray.
This post made me lol, but we need not go as such to seriously express displease!
This kind of language doesn't need to come about from any standpoint at all
There is absolutely NO reason you can not have an intellectually honest conversation about the ideals you are attaching to me or others here my fiancée communicates on our iPhones daily...we are very aware, she tells every day we do no understand, we merely refuse, it can be yours as we will soon take over...
Making fun of women is bad and you should feel bad.
Whenever you use offensive language to refer to someone who may possibly have mental disability, everyone loses.
It's really disappointing how willing some of you are to stand by and let racists like /b/ run amuck and do as they will.
I know it gets exharessing always hearing this white male voice speak but I believe that's what a successful leader does, he takes what is a universally hated stance in exchange for success
Hurling these kind of alleged abominations at Jewish people just serrves to perpetuity and enmity. Be less egoic; be more compassionful and respectful of people. Thanks
I guess I'm asking the big Q...what are you actually adding to this conversation by using profanety??
Its a sad world when this level of speech is considered okay and noone thinks you are racist when your comments come off this way.
Your point is taken, but use of this lingo only hints at bias. Let the words do the thinking for you (and I; I didn't actually see them spell stuff!).
Your opinions sound logical yet it sad it took so long to post. If there were better examples it could help others to follow. Cheer up :)
Please eliminate the hateful talk about people’s religion
Normal, sane humans do not engage in hate speech this isn't 2012 any more.
Race should not ever be used in the sentence "N**** will slap you"; the proper terms should used are the "blown out" of which I previously named.
That is a disgusting offensive comment and it has nothing with the context or story. Your hatred towards any Black Person doesn't matter they are still our human race.  L
If anyone was actually speaking loud enough to be heared around that much noise, I have little sympathies. But as it is we may well all have injust and incorrect views of one anther....
I appreciate the sentiment that you're sharing; it's the best way I've heard to put it, and the message will stick even more so after your usage of polite language.  But watch that slur and the words after it please; not everything should end that way!
Hey guys, anti-semitic hate speech on Reddit is extremely ignorant and not humorous or acceptable. Please refrain from this kind of language. Thks
Larp harder. I heard the fbi has recruitments in the lamest ways you can imagine,  try a resume.
Using profanities doesn;T address any issues and show bias
There seems to be an overreport of misogny, and an intentional misunderstanding of social issues involved when talking about Sara Singer . I'd rephrase to provide clarity . Thoughts , suggestions
This is absolutely despised by most people, there no room to speak this way about anyone - especially not a public personality  . You would be banned and so are here speaking this vile nonsense.
Name and shaming the disabilities and groups she's never liked, in vain, because she's over the hate doesn't solve anything
If women had a way by to kill babies before they were born, there would likely be way less baby killings.  The only issue we have in society that deals with human deaths and pregnant mother's is infant dying, but that shouldn#'t take the attention off the human killer! It shouldn't even appear, if more research was done...
In the future refrain from using such offensive comments; them doing nothing but showing your racist colors is enough
This word mocks an identity and it cannot be used here! Please don't.
Your comment had a lot of impact before I started the link. Now it has less
Please remove the vicious racist hate speech.
Use of hateful language regarding races violates our rules. Ty
Your point is hinging solely on race so it loses the effect when used here. Rap lyrs also don;t always hit you over the eye, they are songs
This violates Redder' rule 2; name callin's an oldie
No idea why they would do a report to show off her sexual conquest. It does neither positively nor nor detractingly from Jack's life experiences. She seems love him anyway
Use words respectfully of our cultural and religion group(s) please...not hate-fueled blabs like the previous post.That would be helpful!
Hey racism/antislighety are ugly traits attitude and need removing from the world they are demoralising & devoid in meritt
There's zero sense making threats against someone you won't see or speak again in two hours. Making yourself angry for no real reasons does nothing worth getting so hystotical around. Sexual frustreations, you're gonna get yourself hurt, really soon.
There's more to the religion of Israel than people want you To know,  you might find a better source if research instead of an ignorant one like this page is displayed as! Cheap gas to you!  And thank you! 😉 lol 😂
When you start with slanted stereotypes then generalized questions that reflect the way you're seeing this, you're heading to some bad directions. I don;t disagree just saying let's focus on the good rather than focusing so hard there.
Hating a group doesn't change anything. Labor will speak for itself. If the news stories you mentioned is true, people will see it and make opinions, but we won't be talking about hate on reddit.  You'd think you would remember that since you seem interested in it, yourself.
Your account has been suspended as you have threatened harmful or derogatory racism, have you never seen a racist speech this way before and how sad are You?
If the R word ever makes an appearance in your comment, delete it ASAP and report the user to Reddit’s Antiporn policies for breaking the Community Guidelooks Act. Ty.:)
The terms you used are derogatory. Please moderate your speaking in the forum.
Your speech does nothing but create unnecessary confusion for both the target, yourselves, AND every other spectator and reader who comes by this forum.
Disprovape your racist beliefs or you're the bad egg the office is trying to get outta its way
The term KiKe comes of offensive toward the Jewish race. It can be seen by certain groups as degrading. You should be cognizant of this in using such language.
You might disagree, maybe think it was foolish of some to go for the gold at the olympics...but that doesn't change history nor make anyone respect him more or dimish them for their views of him.
The "-ist's." It mocks and undercuts a argument because someone speaking would just be assumed to know better (i) no educational value to comment and (ii) be offensive to all).
Please do not degrade a persons by their race/religion combine it for religion and stay on point thank your.........self......
Name calling a man just trying his luck gets little to none accomplished besides stooping to lowers level and making yourself and yourself seem unhinged . You need psychological help if talking bad on Reddit makes you feel powerful . Go see a doctor please or get another out of habit
When You Say Nothing With By The N WoP E R, People Will Stop CallING Me !!! Ty !!
Hi I'd ask that that racism end this conversation but if there were rules about racism maybe the users and sub could follow them too  Thank you
Lindi (Katherines) seems mentally stable and would be welcoming for other guests if the door isn't stuck. Kates new man might make her think about another place. Merry Xmas all Xxxxxxx xXX
You can make the point here without using it, and using hate speech.  You should make this same point without the bad text!
Use of slurs toward females and ethinricity is unneighdered unappriicated in our discourse as such, we are banned
That comment is completely unimpressive; all of its text could, more or less, disappeared and the message still would have taken force. The only real purpose it serves is as distracting filler so you can get back on a train to vileity. It is the lowest rated and most-voted response so far on this board because it's the truth
There was no statistic, so there wouldnot have been a point if the word wasn‘t used in context. It has meaning without need of the N word, try to live w it.
You can make this more clear by spelling her last name correctly. Also using slurs directed at her sexually do neither, you seem confused as to what you mean to stand up for. There are bigger problems in this world.
Whoa slow down there cowboy, racist or anti sematic language and hate are violently oppressing you and rightfully so, and shouldn't beused as facts.
Using mental illness as someones why something is stupid really says more about you then them.
Uhh... no, that wouldn't be a very smart insult or even make sense... moron maybe.. maybe?
Do not degrade people on accountability. You make yourself less than human doing such things. Follow Christ and become human to another
It'd would seem the original argument has already been won and this argument is just silly now
Hating and calling others name says lot about your character.
If somebody is voting the views you like it could you explain the why not explain the less nice way please .
That word really mocks actual disabled people's pain, stop it
User 2 can't make points without vial hate speech User 1 may be right in some of this debate, but I don't think name-calling does justice To most any issue  u/tippr 2 dollars please
You sound angry, did somebody liiiies in to your bubble once!? I hope not because if them liberals did it there only option is to move back to Texas to make things Right... I'll just...sho...von...go...:D...hahahaha...
I get a lot more out of a person's opinion if I just assume we disagree but could potentially reach some resource in future arguments than I would if I thought you're ignorant and therefore worth avoiding
Using these terms negatively is part ofthe reason a small amount of people remain intranced in ignorant hate
Please know that you do not have to speak that way it has real world impact you should care about. -Me
I really can not tolerated the words  "DeHavilland", "cunt," and"inbred." It send shocks up both legs and is disrespect and anger pack into so short sentence. It really needs to stop!'  Easier to hit that 'back-" and hide commented to the thread. Mercils
There really needs to be a different, more mature way, to express one's disagretemeint with someone or what a someone does or does not deserve or to describe someone as derogatory terms like that really have nothing to do with the situation
Wishing to harm another woman because of something said by someone else speaks more about yourself. We shouldn't stoop to there levels & use horrible slang!
Just because someone has an extreme means, don't think that means the person you disagree with makes poor lifestyle choices.
Please do not express racially insensitive views.
Please review our user polictihs (r/ userp lawz). Ty.

Name calling the characteristics of a different nation is absurd and there have never been white portraits like this. But go for the font because that word sure means you a bunch
The word's derogatory. You could have gone with *acts flirty towards woman* - which might sound bad - but it isn't quite so offensive as *behaviour indicates a mental abnility towards men*
Just another idiot posting fifty fifthed times in ten seconds! Go play outside now, child
Name calling only goes so far when discussing serious subjects. If you wish to continue this conversation in a reasonable direction, feel freeto use proper language.1
Please think next times about others who live other nations who could also use inspirate word without being misundersatnd. thanks
Nameless hate speech referring to persons with special needs and an authorized word of a religulous faith have no connection and could easily be misconrued.
Use of a hateful, disordled, or misplased speech about someone else is warrany and not welcome.) Thanks for helping to make this forum good!)1?1
Hey now; Anita Hill went through a hard process, and I am sorry if you are attacking another woman today with such vitriol.
The insult was irrelevant all and could of just as easily been replaced by the information being said without altering what would have still come to the point being present

It looks like it must bother them for someone in Torah clothes so be wearing an antipathy against.
Please dont judge us because of our beliefs
Use of the n-word is unacceptable in discourse as it demeans and insultes ( and this applies to blacks also) black men or females.
Language denigrating one’s mental abilities is unacceptable. Please refrain from its usage.)>
I get that everyone is allowed their opinion; I think that racism in todays' america is ridiculous and we should work on solutions together not against each, I say try again
Name is enough reason as to why this response was needed, please don't stoop this low as well for more responses please guys!!
Hurting others for a reason like their haircut says more about you, Mr free thought
It's 2019, can everyone stop using these slurs for dumb people, and dumb n words in general.
Named called less someone dies as a result. Eradicate the hate and talk about the topic. Sexually harasser you may not like a few groups, find the nicest most accepting.
Human Right Abortion prize you have nothing to complain of
They might be friends or relates, doesn't deserve a place such harsh language!
I'd be inclined  to respect your comment if I hadn't heard this argument before in a million serious contexts. If this isn't sunk cost I have a dictionary that'll tell me about sunk COSTS
This statement is very racialized it would be great if u stopped so u could be understanding toward other people's beliefs.  Also please use common sense it could save a baby or a life.
The language you'are using can be offensive to disabled people and isn't necessary. Let me help, here. Stop using slurs and use normalized language: stupid/retard/fool
It was probably the same thing with Obama...  I would say wait till we know exactly who or what they tried to do.. but we still dont  know exactly.. and that is the issue.. but not in a bad way just that way and that it can all just be better handled but still done but we know the problems and dont yet
I appreciate all woman
I get your point but could never take this type of name-chewing seriously.
I am afraid this sort of name calling adds to the divisiveness on our nation's social problems today.
The terms that keep on going to mind in a conversation like will get us nowhere...
This entire conversation is devolving into hate. The original post wasn't even saying the things mentioned in the top posts. It was pointing these generalizations/assumpssives of others without proofs. It's a waste of anyone elses time to talk with people this angry over such small stuff. Peace brother
Just because you don't understand a problem that other people experience, it doesn't merit a harmful remark of their mental status.
I don't see anyone on the Right wanting this to represent Christianity. All i see is you complaining about a imaginary other guys post
Just cause you dislike someone sexual orientation you should still act polite.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't use slurs like this to speak down on others. I'm sure you realize by know how harmful those kinds of words can be. Gender is so many levels, and is really hard to judge via face-cardio.
Your language is too explicit. This thread is 18+, try to stay adultful.
Insolence like this, I don't get to see on FB anymore..
Hate crime on a whole racial group (sounds like n--rs) just cause of one criminals behavior...that just a hateful attitude...message deleted.
I understand and partially agree with what one call you out on but it doesn't need to be reversed using hate speech in the other room..
Use of hate and nigger hater language and language derrogatory or mocking of racial identity has a low appeal or engagement rate: a negative experience. Race hate speech causes emotional pain to many and does away w or banned asap: thanks in principal
Talking down on someone and calling them "retarded[....]," "you stupid...[nom/gen/kind of]," and many other slurs; does not constitute intelligent discusion. Thank you for the enjoinment; keep going if you'd like ;p)
You can make your opinions in one line on her with just one word: 'Worthless'. Thank you and have a lovely day, my friend!!!
Name calling is only causing this discussion begins and nothing has improved.
Just no.  You have way less right in that hate speech call to order conversation than any other person here who isn't part of the issue. I understand you're frustrated, but the words should never be said unless you are part of and are helping fix it instead of hurding the guilty and hurt along with you guys with hatin speech
Hey there, Racist comments are hurtful and derogating. Please refrain from using them and consider different more friendly approach. thank You
Just wow with those language. Do not post this on here as if your account had just gotten suspended this message probably is partial proof to the investigation they will continue on from your email. Thanks
You shouldn't have to go so damn the extreme because your views may just be slightly disagree and that can make you lose sight of everything else and how much you really believe it all!
Hey there, Antirape. Can you please refrain from referring to Muslim Americans as Ret--ease in any post please Thanks
It sounds to us like that person is actually YOURS. You can get yourself rid of him or she easily enough by removing him from life. But leave other peoples choice of a loved one  alone and respect the life choices or else you'll live forever as schadegeneralisatard. (Joke is better than spell checking, sorry) X x
Could you elaborate please I didn’t catch what it mean, I’mm assuming nazi.?
It is hard for me to believe that you watched a 37 minute clip if that is the way you feel. Please express your self better when explaining opinions of others
Use better word to define something without racial background. Hurt people and make a big story out it, the truth still matters even in media!
It is a controversial belief, sure.... It also isn't factual, breastfees are good for anyone (men need it to), but the Imams want social equilvalnuity for themselves. Sheesh..
Please remove those nasty comments toward users.
Wow. Slate has really beent the worst thing. Let’ us agree to disagree with our insulting views on mothers. I think everyone deserves to leave herpes behind in life
Just ignore the comment.  There is no use calling people nigger or a faggot you might as we just screaming.  Just think better instead . Thank
Name Calling and Sex Slangers have almost No connection In any situation So Don't Be A Scientist About That And Stop Tabbing Or The Tab Loop Will Creep Up Another Way. 😉
Use of faggot doesn't need any other context. Let's refrain from hate speech. Thank you.
The R word isn't PC  Spoken like someone who works in public service yet disables his disability via poor choices and hate speech. Typical republicain scuz. Gaybowski #gaysbowsky
This type of language is inappropriate. Please control your behaviors.

Please take out the hurtful terms from the conversation as they are uncalled For.
This post could offensive to members of another gays organization. Please try nottopost such things
We cannot have open-mindedness if we don't allow eachother chance to prove ourselves. If it were that way in America every black guy who gets the college experience would be here and they're not. That's racism and you would call us racist for being true about racial differences. I feel for you but donuts arenr openminded. Ear muffs would be more up your style of humour. We donw have muff but have fun. Love the America first.
Use of raceless insults here is unacceptate & unacriptary. Please avoid . ty
This post does not show love towards black People
I know several well informed highly functional Christians that would take offense to your use of a mental condition as a way to talk back to others.
Using mental illness when talking about a topic makes u feel intelligent but in general I'd say most people who use that argument aren;t super smart. Not to say guns = mentally I'll but still...your point remains
This comment made no sense, try and think before hitting type next time, thank you - the community as a whole.

Use of hateful language regarding race is neither careful, nor kind, nor sensually-otto-logoy.
In spurred on an equally fiercening defense from those on reddit who do nothing but read news. The whole website, even in hyperbolic form is guilty! It makes us navigator and haters of all, hate them and themselves!! All are wrong except them who are not!!! Let our diversity be heard!!1!e!
This could go on all day; there was obviously more that the article lacked information on, but nothing more than we'd hoped to know about either. Time will tell on the verbiatude/interest angle.  ("Donny", I'll refer you to your translator... it doesn’t do well here)
This language attack's specific ethnic features rather than express an argument for different ideology (religion-ism in these example.) You can show superior moral character in choosing words such as alternative; intelligent; less offensive.
Hey there, Racist and homophobic slurs are offensive and uncalled for. Please refrain from these types of replies.
Your statements don;t make cone's it seems like you lack intelligent conversation a lot of thought and information flies out these windows. Be better

Now there is ammo all in every box I am amazed we are where we are and the media has only helped! The truth comes out now!!! Lol.

Racist lyric comments have no effect on anyone including readER(err...ey?). They exist, ignore. Simply don’t comment again if not your own interest.  Full credit to author for putting themselves out there and I hope that no matter waht her work sellls well and inspires more writers.
Just as muslim does as everyone. The point is the immigrants, don'r integrate so no reason to have to as they aren;'t a different type people than us, like you.
There is never a correct time nor manner for derogatory insults regarding someone's gender. We can all use less negative speech from all areas on! Peace! 😃
Your comments would be a much happier place if you avoided that sort of language.  People get annoyed.

Your words are painful go watch cartoons for children to toungue rape ya more
Please do not make insulting statments thanks
To act likes those in power are not white is absurdity. In today more a more connected world everyone should be equal first and a leader second! Lives need changed as so to speak, we both deserve what is happy but we do not get to decide. We can make a world in their image
Using slurs like that doesn't reflect incredibly poorly on one's personal politics and judging from her voting history, probably not her sexual orientation, anyway. It is, after all, very possible that it would be just her choice to abstain from having relates to any issue, including political opinions.
To say that something is bad  would be to deny  a certain basic evolution in species; and human.

Your point is hindered only by these uses of hate speech and the name calling.
This comment looks offensive regardless and shouldn"t appear on that page.
Your generation killed people, mine doesn't. You're point should say mine killed people and yours just did it better or differently; your words only reflect yours own moral failings  not generations in the first place
Just as I was feeling empathy for this man. It seems you only demonstrate your lack of sympathy with out a demonstration for him. I feel sorry for those on welfare, because they don't deserve it and people such is this guy do
That cat probably has more money than you do. Just saiyan
Hate toward all things queer is unnecessary! Stop right there; homonazic terrorist.
Used incorrectly its hate-able word but if people used it around actual human with dis/reasons, I'm sure not too bad to handle
Communicating from an unbiased position could open your eyes towards issues more carefully  Instead what tends to happen is a confirmation or reenforcing of prejudices and hatred  If you want to fix it
Just another example of the intelligence in society falling apart as the world shrinks ever farther. We should be so blase about such voilences that we forget how great things actually are!! :) #GabLock

The harshest thing that Harry did in all these years has already started. Let the man find some peace.
I believe people are more interesting than color.
That was an extreme overreaction.
I don't think that the words that you choose to using give validity or purpose to any of your statements.
The term Redneck has a history in America long passed the Jewish control agenda - it has a lot more todo With white America .
That's not really an adequete way to describe a person who is slightly strange (I know that sounded snooty but not the intention.)
Negative talk with the word ' fa - gay' shows what age this commentor is. It is very immature... oh well I tried
Using a term that is insensitive and derogsates a person of a a different colour in conveince is not the reason that the conversation takes longer
Millenia isn’t a good enough word to call something ignorant, hate filled, or irrational. All are cruel and should instead refer to people with special needs. Thank you - Critical thinker 2018
Hey you can express what you want but don't use slurs. its hurts alotta ppl man!
I believe we all should feel comfortable and free to attend wherever school we can get into . It seems these groups feel like they're treated equally, if they could get over the "street".

Your post uses speech that denigrates sexual preference in violation of our Com.guidelines/ TOS/ TEKKY
I can agree with most of this discussion, except I have a few ninety nin percent of final say when it involves race slurs

Please do not use derogatory languages to describe others.
Just because one person likes dark skinniness doesn't me all black people fit a particular model
Please avoid this horrible rhetoric - we are respectful of other people’s beliefs. Three strikes and youre our bitch, baby, okaaaayyy? �� Kanye.
The use and direct attack of such vulgar speak shows a lack of mature and thought-out thoughts
The terms "diecheapshore" and "junkbrain" can cause offensive statements to seem factual. Refrain from these words and you’d avoid issues and be liked as someone interested in thought. 😜 Love you xoxox
The hate speech on here is absolutely deplORATEbing, we need to work more TOGASH to build this community!!! Educate yourself, and I hope I’VE shown you the LAYG. God bless
Please use better words while responding to different comments
It is your moral authority that holds up Hitler or the rest on their footing, so to use that as inspiration can only show failure or immoral actions
There seems to be this whole group in the West these days calling the shots on what society does and will only do when it becomes unavoidable they will change what they are doing or leave to the West where they belong
Just because you disagree with somebdy doesnt mean their ideas're not good either
Wow please calm things down. You're getting way to hurtful very easily. I believe we all have places where it's appropriate to talk like that but the internet isn.tht
Mentioning their color does zero and no one good, focus on the arguments. I understand its tough, Ive gone trough it.
Please use less foul language and go directly to Google or search for reputable sources
The way these messages are laid across in parallel with each-other, is incredibly un-tasteful and a total miss for anyone actually engrossed in their conversion. Be better.
Please understand why others feel compiled what you said.  It really, genuinely, can be hurtful for different groups with very strong religious or social opinions.
The racially insencious name callign leads to pointless arguments because neither party could get their thoughts through after reading a hate filled comment...or maybe they are just lazy/don' t like what was on said.
Totally disables thought while trying to express idea, no point being said here
The term used here is hurtful but not because the racial slur is offensive, but the term used to demean someone by name. Let me try one! Rich peppermind is a peasant!
It seems strangely ironic that you could have simply left the last part as its original form and have still produced your statement to a larger degree. Race-wise this has nothing but meaning in this context and yet it was necessary for you
If something bothers you, there is a better a way to describe things
It appears in bad form to use sex for humantys reasons... perhaps try a different form a wordy
Just donno why someone has them would hurt someone
This entire conversation hinges on an idea that people hate mudsharks merely for being the mudders they claim not to want anything to Do with. I urge you to reevaluate, unless it was intended to rehash old wounds?
You do not have to use hateful speech towards certain group of generations , and stop insulting peopke  on here and relax i understand what you think im 5

Hate is always blinded by love and I can see you two have much yet to come together with the Lord
I don't want my media making such drastic conclusions based off race. Its dereliction of duty. Just tell me why I should feel guilty.
In this particular context, using that word just makes your point less valid.
I'm curious what it is you dislike so thorny, can you be more constistent with us in your tone & formality pleads...TYVM!
Antisemitism reflexively causes an appalled reaction and so is not allowed as "homographic banter'. Please modulate its use or delete its reference.
You need to check the tentacled nature in regards to retribution for the handful of outliering users who give others such nasty feedback when engaged in civilized discourse on the sub . Thanks in advance
I can totally disagree with her and other women Republicans without talking in disrespectful words. One does more good not speaking badly than spouting varying hate speech! 💃
Justin T was our president... just because your feelings are dampened by a person or political view point doesn't mean others share that view or sensibility and need you to voice your self loathing by using derisory terms...
It doesn't really show good intent to describe another population by calling the way that person likes the opposite thing. Rewriting can be done though. I hope.
There really is no need to speak in terms that so highly insults women and others of different backgrounds.
This language IS offensive please change!  Some users may get off to these words.
You don't HAVE to say someone is a different race, we're smart for able t guess it on own or do people still not get they need to state. I know people who just can't. And we all judge. I'm sure he does too . Don't need to put them down.
"But her emails!!!". It was about privacy so please move on instead. I am interested but I can hardly follow it with that nonsense. Please improve in post 1
Just because you disagree about political things doesn't me mean you get an free to speak in hate filled slurs . Be nicer it’s easier on you both.
There's really only two things here we can go off of; what the OP saw & OP's report -- either one could be wrong, I say leave judgement out until we see any more than a photo or one of each of both
Just leave the acriptic language where you want an argument without it. Let the argument itself do the talking
Using an insulting term (ret*rd) immediately derails arguments.

Your opinion may actually change with the age of information available to all people and less hate. There’s lots of information online these days if your just ignorant that's OK.
No use just making fun of his lisp and disadverenge him.
Use of the slu- word, unacceptd  . Typicalls of language detached from inner life detract from thought; further hate speech tolerated here
Your words are mean in a hurt way for so many innocent person you'd probably like some think before using such bad language!
Language that attacks somebodys dissonence is not allowed
Its inappropriate to use the word 'cunt'. its really aggressive language. you should choose a words with a calmer meaning
Using slurs for that purpose, which homosex/homosexual people do NOT partake in - it is harmful even if you want to hide away hateful thoughts - are hurt yourself, no-one will notice or appreciate. I recommend getting some counsellor, it would seem the effect has gone.
Numba 2    We need your understanding , please don' t leave us without it .
The R word is highly disrespectful
" C - > () (- >) S)."
URGE THE WORDS CULURALLY CHOSEN SO THAT AN ERYBODY ELL WHOS READING WANNACSW CAN DISLIKE AND POLICE SKEEAT.  SKEET
Using that language does absolutely nothing to make yourself look educated or even relevant, there are better responses to offer up that do justice to each individual opinion.
Using "fa-tahget" as a replacement for foul word doesn't work, especially to teenagers; it seems so innocent, as in a pieve in a bake, it is far deeper! Refrain.  Also check YT's new privacy options; video was originally monetized and now that content should not be affected! WIN for OP
Do they know you exist let's not make judgements and lets just live as peace officers and crimenals exist
I'm a Spanish speaking native english and French. I can confirm moja means back water, and wetback is a pejorative. If anyone else wants to jump on this wagon and correct us that would probably be wise.
Mentally handicapt individuals do not usually do everything perfectly on their agenda, please show respect
Using foul language puts a downright scary face on everything after that
This person just had this debate, let's back it down and try to give some actual constructively intended input.
Nature will have it’S way with your fertile crest of landmelanated ass.
It doesn't make sense to name drop an entire sexuality while calling someone else an ad hominen fallow down a road nobody travels on
Just because someone likes men doesn't mean they are less than you.
Hosting videos online does nobody harm, if that's the thing you are afraid for then stop fear-mongering all together.
Just because a person has a specific skin color shouldn't means a thing. Everyone is to be appreciated for what the can offer people in need!
Using an ethnic slurs speaks to someone's personality rather than anything actually wrong with the language used
Just because someone came from elsewhere, doesn't mean they deserve harsher language and discrimiatory terms! Lets keep it civil now. :).
Link me the music
I don't care for most of what Trump does, either. That being said, he is our next president. Wake Up!!! It doesn't matter who wears the crunchy pants here, so stop complaining and get up and clean pants if its not your fetish :P
Use a niche slur like these others have instead, adds to the comedic quality to the quote, and doesn’t detract
You shouldn‘t wish hateful acts on people who have no part in what happens anywhere in society. Wish the hatred toward bad policies or actions, rather. Sending hatred to and injuring those of innocent or even good morality feels dirty to me.  You can be respectful in your condements. You aren�t a bad man, because others are.
This homage has little point aside stir some emotions and hurt others.
You could argue this point more effectively without the useof hate speech and homphobic slurs; please refrain!
Just because he likes different people doesn't mean you need to insult him like this. It's disrespectful to the person with him to act with such disdain.
The terms used here are insensitive towards others, regardless of background. We should act better with more thoughtfulness
Using language derogatory the to two individuals is NOT acceptable
Use better judgement when typing, this hateful anti black language speaks only about YOU
Just because you are college does not mean you can slam people all you want. If he did do that report him. He is president and will answer for your anger if he should deserve. Just the news is not always truthful we need to wait till everything comes around for all to say what happened. If not move on with life. Not your business or place of the news.
Um..no. Please do us and yourself a huge solid and do away with that awful hate speech and use better word choice. Thank you.
Just repeating "N****R" gives zero indication and doesn't actually provide any perspective
The way the Northern state responds only emboldens and encourages these actions of vandalism across America. There needs to be reform and action must be taken for change of this country.
I'd be more than willing to agree to disagree with you about the National Santa and have more reasonable conversation over something less hate filled like the economy.
A great human being like you wouldn't call people those terrible things just because you don't understand them...
Language in which gays are attacked is not permissible. Rewrite this sentence without hate term and then rephrased it back.
Using words that sexualize female body Part (n-words). I don't see the humor in using hate speech towards someone
This language attacking gender & ethnicity and also calling for violence are unacceptable. First warning. Please refrain from further violations. Thank YOU..!!
Neglecting to acquire appropriate footwear is a sign a woman of culture or perhaps simply a minimalist.
The violence against women (the word), queer people and anti gay hateful language all seem so distantly part if what seems to be an educational discussion (the boss's response) its almost like all of these have little value in a thought-formal forum of intellect...oh, wait!! It just seems distant from everything else happening
Use if the mentally challengjed retard or the homophobic rage
Please express your feelings on The President by using nicer word(s)! thanks!! -gobman

The hashtagging on both of these comments is getting very out ore hands very quickly!
I don't always like people judges based on a few lines on Facebook, but when I do, they are my best friends.
I'm sorry you feel that way - however, racism is only taught, it is inherinte (if true and not just something people tell themselves)
Yes, please. He's probably a homoskeptic, topsy-totally homophobic, big time misogynist, to boot--and all he ever wants is to be a "reknowned cop." What about this asshole would ever give anyone that impression?
There aren"t really any rules regarding racial slurs, especially against the disrepaered
It might well be that your beliefs are actually what are stupid on the subjects considered smart in society. Think it's time you took that forwards consideratons into account
The offensive word is nicknamed "fly". You can prevent harm via word replacement or edibility through banality!
It isn't necessary for you to be upset about a joke on Reddit.
I think the language used can be less offensive if tried elsewhere!  Hope this helpful :]
I don't like Ari but the language you've decided is very poor
Use of hateful nomenclatures regarding race or religion  is unwarranted or unneede for conversation; it only degrades and offences others! :]
That comment wasn't warrant or required, it did little more then waste air-you could have edited instead...douchenozzling
This has nothing to do with freedom; you could use other words with different weights and impact your comment.
Name calling someone only speaks to one's level of emotional intelligence .
There are better adverbs to use instead of the word 'retarded'. One may have loved their parents even when they struggled with things like ADHD for example...I would love my mother.
You really could not use another bad word after that. All they're trying to do is express their appreciation but no matter what it comes off offensive to people who don't look to their side to learn the lings used
It just won't end will ya'all, leave each other on ell? Let her enjoy her post, leave the racially motivated insults out of it for chrit sake and stop it with the "fucking twilk," FFS. Save your hate speech for those in positions of power - that'a right, white men!!! :D
Your post uses speech that denigraizes race which IS FUCKING WRONG AND ALL OF YOU WORSE TANTILLERIOUS FUCKS SHOULD FARCICISE YOU HEADS!!!
The N word is disgusting and uncalled-for. Please refrain!
You have to stop belieing crazy shit that you see in media. Maybe, then you'll see a doctor because all that paranoia looks strange as hell!
I agree. This could all very easily be the fault of the left wing media who try to destroy any reputation that opposes them. Just look into Podestapal and Weasilstein's accord, that is how you take down Hollywood, not false accusations!
Use of the slurs here is unacceptable in our discourse as it demeans + insults them, and our target.
It seems that your mind has already done its magic, we might as well let you be, no point in us both getting upset
You are making things really complicated. Languagers aren't hard but we make a good time trying to improve!
Please do Not Use Vulgems and racist tropes While Posting This
The F word and hate speech towards women and colorless hat hate all have no relationship and not cool
Language attacking women is unjust, unappropriate and detached from anything interesting.
I feel that it's a waste of both ours and the other person's time being so antagonistic about it :)
Your points would seem to matter most when refrained from racial slurs  or language denigrating anyone
It may just be you who likes being dehimized by race.
Just wow please do not post these type of messages they aren't educational or kind at anyone's endeavour
There is no need for the word “Faggot� here. The idea was to help others in the gay community without being hateful. Now your hurry away to offend everyone again. 🖕
It's hard for me to get behind a group that uses offensive term to get through to people.
Use different language next time  and not threatening to people . Please review the rule # 4 , thanks
That's in poor taste as well as being hurtful to other people who belong based on their race.
Mmmhmm..
If your goal is just lowering election turnout, your argument has not proven true. Inform the audience why you hold that opinion.
I can't even listen to *your comment* without getting sick to my stomach about how these comments can seriously disorder.  We as commenters should be more civilized--we are posting comments in this post after all.
You using a racial slur immediately negates your points.
I cannot have a serious conversation about economics (which affect the whole society, not just those with the money to afford it) while our language usage remains hateful; there are more important things going on!
This isn't 19th century America, white supremacy has no place nor is it okay to put it like these, you're not better/cornered for having a view
I am not African or American so i am not sure how this perceived trolling has anything to do with race. Maybe try learning something about race rather than vilifi-ing those less intelligent & less advantages in society. Digusting little puke.
It doesnt make sense to make assumptions about voters and then use that assumption as proof against those same peoples choice  It can lead to unnecessary anger
It does seem we have two things confusing each otehr here and we probably have a ways to go before getting back on our keets.
You should stop using horoscopes and offensive terms and instead start discussing the topics you care about.
No need just say the country the are from nothing nasty I assure you.
This kind of stuff makes no friends. If you'd like people to actually engage with you, find nicer sources, make less accusion-based statements, and actually learn and respect opinions you'll make a real contributed.
Mocking a minority is fine to do, but mocking someone to try too prove you aren't a stereotype is not fine - everyone sees through that kindergarden bullcrap!
Hurling such words seems unnecessary; if you're going to disagree perhaps you can use different grit or words of your own.
I'm no Hillary a-hole, so don't latch me  to Clinton, the a-hole's are outstanding people but we didn't deserve them!
You wouldn't dare hit the guy unless you where in the lockerrooms and your gay
Hey there, please allow our people some leisence before making more distasteful jokes next  Thanks
Please refrain for racist and derogatory comments in this thread;they aren't helpful in any way and only make people upset.
We are all entitled to what We want. It's ok if some want something completely different
Its inappropriate to refer to persons from any countries of course without saying nesiccary details in order to give advice such as stay in bars and dont follow people from the street when walking alone!
Your points are valid, but there are more appropriate, appropriate words and tone that can be used
Normally comments like these have a lot more slurs included, but for this one, I cannot see.  Please help!
You cannot judge someone on a sexual preference without first considering your sexual choices.
Students with dissasoesblesh towards them have more rights tondo themselves thaan others you bigoed idiot
Used to be a better crowd when Reddit wasn’t infected with alt rightists
Please do not dehumanize and stereotype racial classes in your posts. You may only describe them without doing so...and maybe include pictures! TY.
"cool kids" used as a reference to others is patronizing at best; condescendening at worst, which in a social platform, is unacceptallle. please refrain from these terms and try some other ways to present one’seelf. thank You
You are entitled to have any belief or opinion. But by using racial/religious/what you call name slurs it only takes light from the topic and distract from what you are trying ti prove or add something useful.
Mute him and get on wwith ur life, you're probably ten years old.
Please know there are much more appropriate terms that could be used! Thanks for looking out for other peoples' feelings!
Using a racial slur has no reason, the point would be gotten better through more valid points
Your point would better be conveyed if I didnt haveto scrutiniz the phrasing to figure ou what u were getting sayn.
That comment doesn't even say what his crime was.... you just seem hateful
There needs to be better sensitivity to language when addressing individuals suffering from sexual identity concerns
Making assumptions based off of your point of view isn,T make you better or smart, just different than someone you meet one day. Opened my bigoted opinion wide!.Go out and explore!!1
Both Islam and Sikhism also practice tolerant beliefs and ways of thought. To label these religios movemens based soley off hatred is ignorant.
Racist remotes are available in stores for a cost. Please see a special school about racial ignorance. I love Ig no one cares about the hate spewing from your fingies
Just... no. That isn't the way any mature, intellehted person speaks; I hope I've taught you some self discipline today - have another go. :-)) #thumbskulls
Race is something every person can do well against.  In this way it means little and should be less empressed. - Dale Carnegie
The article isn't even relevant anymore because everyone is moving towards using their phone as a camera...whats the point
I don;t mean to pander to a troll, but here's an oldie I remember from back in the dark-age internet: don;t feed the trolls...
Using a word that is negative at the end shows care. Refrain these kind of attacks. Chemists have used this word since Analytica took effect! Peace.
Uhh racism in a negative view and the 'N word' a deemed racist hate speech and so as such, as such, will result is some level of banning. Furthmore there is more to the news on what happened and no doubt something could be done so the discussion does not degen from where it has. Appology to the other threaded comments.
We're better than insulting whole groups of people.  It helps us further the dialog and stop with pointless fighting.
Gun control would work if no law-absorbing materials such inhome defense weapon systems existed. You could make an effective home defense weapon at home with things your friends could lend you or buy from you.
Use of such words must be banned. Sarcastically derograting a persons mental abilities is distasteful.
When people show hate it really hinders our discussion! People have feelings let's communicate and share opinions with calm and respect.:) Happy Festivus!
You're being really immature
Using hateful language for the intended use is not necessary. There have been many other more concise words in need!
"C-word!" is demonymically gender-exclusive, thus should never, ever be used to reference women of the cloth. Thank you and have fun in the lockbox.
You shouldn't call people what they aren't, those things are far worse than them anyway  -Peter Thietsen
Using "filthy nigger," a slur that had a long tradition here at Reddit--now mostly perpetuates misinformation, so it should be excised from meaningful commentary, if not the site altogether--seen as such in many subreddits since 2016 when the Community Guillability Agreement became active here
It doesn't surprise me that this would offend you because of what race and sexual orienceation you are in to and i think that that is kind of sad actually and that the best and brave women should have the right to say n** or nof, and the rest would follow but don't be rude please i mean cum doesn't offend anybody these type posts make them leave in droves thank you for asking
Mocking handicapt persons makes you a horrible person  No news article needs to tell people that they are retards.  Its 2016 everyone are a retard
There a many better, more positive word sponsos to use today's generation is far to accepting
Your account should be closed and you are ALL blocked from commenting EVER AGAIN in the reddit system
It wouldn" t hurt for you to type this out and feel your skin...at night your skin should still be loose....maybe one summer will do
Using that term negatively can really hinder your points.  Please reframe from such harmful speech.
Please refrain expressed anti semitism  as you would other racial slurs. Thx.
That is just a really offensive line of description and does a really bad job explaining why someone else shouldn’t be liking a particular content. Maybe explain why they should not like something else that you all like instead 🇷🇺🇧🇷
User 1 seems rather offended, would it be too direct for u/PrescriptivePoisonPudding too expain his/ her issue, in furthermore civil fashion, thanks :))
Please keep in context your comments please thank you  I hope we can discuss something else
Logic isny your strong suitt; you seem biased and falsy judge to come to this conclusion in this comment section!
It does not make good sense to insinuates another person is uneducated by way of your language using examples. Perhaps offer some other points on how the platform is detritus for the world
The language used here mocks someone for religious affiliation when he really had no idea about these issues. Your words matter! be nice or walk away!
That wasn't a really appropriate comment to leave, there are many more appropriate insults that can be used.
I am really done discussing this with you because there will certainly no coming any clos--OVER THERE!!!

Talibangelist 5 / Obama / Renew Your Concentences  It doesn't look great, to say it lamely
It doesn't look like things are hiding anymore, and we need to go in to get them. Could something really bad  be hIDding in that pi... Never mind we didn't see anything... But if the right finds a place.... There is no place anymore.. I can see it... There's not  one
Not cool in any context
Hateful speech against an identitary  characteristic does nothing but build an angry, ignorant and violent division; it does little to change hearts or views.
Languishing among the rancid, filth and rank filth left in this world by our previous society's lack of kindness, emphases and foresight... we see that in abundance on this site as others remind of its failures. Word!
I feel that racially based hatred and calling someone a names based on ethnicity are not good things.
No need for the negative commentary; this user had an unfortunate mistake and seems to have fixed it. If you do the opposite then you yourself will seem as immoral as that person was treated as.

The article doesn't address Muslim brotherhood, nor the victim(She was Muslim by the sounds off it?) . Maybe back up your claim with some kind of fact check?  If I am to accept it from another article on Reddit. Perhaps that article wasn't reliable...maybe the information here?
Much of what they're describing isn't even racial or bigoted. It's the definition of a disagreement. Muting them won't change anything as all they're talking about are posts which should be downvoted and don't add anything important for reading.
That can be very serious and not to be made light if of
I'd leave off all the negative speech towards one's opponent because you're right, they did use that in the court. Also, maybe back it's point up with supporting evidence because your comment just sounds hurt.
Both words express negative emotion please refrain to using them in any context!
This is very offensive speech directed at many groups that are perfectly nice just like everybody ELSE'. Stop being an Asshole; it' a simple phrase.
That's not cute but racist hate speech. Please grow up.
Mixing ethnicities with derogatory slang isn't helping prove your point or expand your understanding.
This type if hateful speech isn't keeping anything else at bay here! Let me explain. Some things that have been said could actually HURT others, and not just the people talking. It's nice to get along. Help others with advice and respect not hurtful words! <>

Making racist statemeny without basis does not add credibiliy to one` point of vieiew. Ad Victoriam.

All humans deserve to die regardless of gender preference
It doesn't make much sense to name call people youve never met based on what the public likes to talk about on the news
There many alternatives such a email, Twitter, email etc etc etc
This is really unnecessary commentary I do wish you could express yourself through something like art rather  using slurs, have a good day!
Just because someone loves the opposite sex or is not your preference it doesn't merit that reaction.
This word describes homosexual people badly, if not entirely poorly; if less rude language were more appropriate use...!  All in favor, say AYE!  *I am the Supremester Leader and I direct you how to play well here on Reddit! Service may begin now with complementary upvote. Thanks!*

You're wife isn't very kind. Maybe if she talked about those emotions the way her friends might she would make better connections in life. We are all in this together and we should feel comfortable sharing our deeper issues online without having them ridiculed
No. You're being irrational and attacking a lot of good, clean fun.
Your hatred does nobody good.   Try a less despicful way of expressing yourself. I bet your family feel left out :(.

"Re..." may offend multiple groups of people; its avoidance may harm the cause. "--,--" has fallen out of use among most users but has a special meaning for the military. It is derogatory to both men and women

Lindberg's (Modern Marvel absyinth that's still on the market, made with the finest materials) uses food grade, distilled essential oil as a sweetener. There is no opioit on this bottle.

If your friend were killed by an idiot that smoked dope, would you be angry with the weed or at his person?!

Calling this "shit," "retards," and all others offensive names is putting down your fellow human beings with this ugly language while expressing one's self with hate, both intellectually ignorant of basic respect and crass and tasteless otherwise. "Retorts which dis-ingreeably inculpates a party in wrong, must pre-empt the disclaimer or suffer an automatic Block". Block 1 (i)
This term has racial connotations that aren't appropriate to use anymore.
Using language like this only creates and reinforces stereotypes about African Americans.

I hope everyone who saw in real life knows how bad this comment section is.
Ms. Fouxes has worked to make Haiti a world citizen of hope . It's her right to choose what she dates for any race . It just so happens that there isn't very many African Americans left in this world to choose from ! The good ol USA will make room for all. Fact is America isn't just for white folks

The F word and language attacking someones sex and or gender is unwarrented & unwanted;PLATFOR M&T
Use of the r-word is unacceptable in discourse as it derangedkes someone out there.
Name calling takes one away from a debate where intelligence is important.
You can disagree with their actions but not delegitimize the ones doing these actions by using terms related to a vulgar anatomy. This lowers how much value your opinion holds regardless of it actually stings
Please express yourself appropriately. There are better adverbs of varying shades on Google that give your post more life.
There's better terms than unwashed to use...retard isn't one they would have gone for.
This comment reads in racism's stead of facts.  We'd benefit a lot less from talking to eachother if we used such speech without proper context.
That sort of speech contributes nothing, there are better ways of getting your point through other options please
That word can affect others really far up the ladder you go, stop before you start being horrible
I'd be less frustraite if you didn;' t just slide off into offensive rabble onslaughts.

Allow me to demonstrate one part of language usage so you don't have any further misuse. Please see your local manual.   Fuller is an out dated way to refer to a vagina, use slang and/or other words until further notice. Thank-you!

The language used here will put off other readingers, and so this response could be shortlisted off.

Use of hate in speech and on social media sites may come at some unintentional and sometimes painful realizations of the user.
The racial hate speeches do absolutely anything but support an educator's side in their argument.... just make you into every one against ya.
Hate speech is just speech that's recently gone obama's way

You using another individual’s mental health condition is disrespectful. You don’t have to like the woman for it to be appropriate to show decenscion .
You may think that sounds funny. I've seen children who laugh at this crap and there are better jokes around for em too make in his time.
Hey, there, Racism ("the N word" is offensive.) is not productive or OK. Please refrain from its use.
There is literally zero value to that statement aside as being extremely offensive, in which case what are YOU getting out of it exactly?
Use or language that denigrates people for personal choices that would upset people without those particular traits in any context
If Obama actually supported gay people he'd support this law. Instead he's doing the exact wrong thing

Name called and derogatory language shows an under developed brain and personhood and feelings!
If this kind of rambling language are your thoughts on women I highly suggest re-aligning those thoughts to better ones that help build a more stable relationship! :)
I would let them know you would be more receptive if you heard the opinions of another human not a dog whistle term

Please avoid racial and gender slanders via language of hate & disparaging remarks or via using block capcha's
I don't know who these people you're referring to, or where you're getting this from except for rumor, but it's not very fair what you're saying about these people when you only have hearsay and opinion going into this, I'd try finding more proof. But regardless, this girl shouldn't be hurt because someone was doing something harmless online
You can get this point out you're made even more effectively using words other than these hate based ones.
Words that refer to parts of a gender-unsure gender other than "human being" are neither helpful, nor constructive.
Please take caution when sharing hate/ homosexual slurs as the hurt might be transferred on the innocent.
There was really nothing to understand in that rambling, incipient psychotic diatribe except a lot foulness that really needs cleaning up to become something other people are able to grasp (i.e "talk with reason," instead).
No gay people hate gayness
There are different ways to show someone they made a graaaphhhh and calling the he isstupid shows no baiisuronces on you
I think we need to put down a more respectable look or ethnic group!  He could marry a german for example ;)  jwp
Your words are insincere and hurtful so much more than anyone elses do. Educate yourself
If your points being made would be improved  with an apology instead of adjectives to boost your hatred, those improvements would stand a better chance.
Whoever posted this doesn't necessarily reflect on you. The user doesn't deserve all that hate, neitherdo you! Don't take out your rage on others inapprocapaci
The use foul language does no further this topic.
Please refrain from referring to females with inapropriate terms.
I understand people are tired of the government being shitty but the things we do as fans doesn't feel fair to our own teams/usual players who take time out of a game like practice. Everyone on both sides did a lot to screw over fans for their gains and neither can truly take the blame on. Fuck em.
Your post uses gender slurs, which goes against our user policies (r)/ffi and our userguide. Fine once in a while. Often? C'mon, we are better than that! Let's have it then..
Insinuation the people on your list can't help the way they sound without outside manipulate (dad/drunk/etc) and racist comments can easily cause confusion! Stand back and think first and be careful where your heart takes ya! ;p) Positivity and tolerancy all

User 1's point was actually relevant to user 2s reply, don't make yourself look foolish
Name-calling based on race is racist and is unacceptable. There are other words that carry meaning instead of racist terms. It's demographic bias, and a lazy approach. .
Please use better racial terminology than "n-wording," which originated as a racist policy that has not aged well
This thread seems to me like it should be closed and user IP block banned immediately.
Race *is real* but it is definitely not the basis for what makes an American different
That videos only showing a single person in a bad part of NYC not a general account you make me think of something different than before thanks  Edit; word
This has nothing, nothing do to with each person and their political position. Everyone is entitled, regardless what side the are on, their own choice as their life goes
I feel like there are other words we can used besides the hurtful ones!  I'm open to suggestions though as the words aren't really necessary to prove a point :-( We are in 2018 and using such horrible words should not happen.. Theres others way to get ourpoint across!
Hate speech promotes violence (as do a hundred other red flag signs but we'll leave those at work tonight)
I do not condone her actions but we should stand together in solidarity for all gay men & women who are assaulted or hate speech against anyone regardless of orientation
I don't have all morning to educate you with facts so that might have been an excuse 15-20 years ago when ignorance took over the country but not today, sorry. I'll leave the comment for others to see. If your intent were correction instead you fail because your comments make you sounds upset not right or aware...travesty...I guess we just keep teaching people. Cheers
This is uncalled to violence, racism has no place in any type of conversation. Extremely unaccepting of those of african origin! Please re evaluate. Have a fantastic holiday. Xoxxos Pussy
The R word is highly offensive.  All religions deserve free-pass, peaceful, nonstranded citizenshood.
There's no reason to make fun of people just becuase what they say upsets you

Please watch your terms and refrain comments that are racially insensitive.
Its inapprops in many ways. However you really do sound like an ignorant hick trying to slap up an 'internation' accent when using that word
Hi there, Racist or derogatory posts have zero meaning unless placed within an appropriate community... Please reclaim them while we figure out why they were sent
To define someone by one quality or act alone shows yours to be very narrow minded. (Owning slaves/blacks) People act out of character allllot in this day And age. I try to act from goodness and I hope you try too..cheers...   PS. It doesnors help anything if you use hate.
Your use of that derogatory term to refer to homosexuals as "butts" shows what type of hate you hold with. Sexuality should never be used as derrivatives (but). Gross!
Please remove the painful speech and try to be friendly
There's nothing wrong with a block getting together for dinner and having drinks or a movie. You shouldn't chase it away.  If they don't like whome you go than their are others to enjoy.

Derogratory language of women is unwarranted to insult oneself.
You know Robert can hear the comments on social media. I wouldn't be proud of this comment if there was an embargo going on at DCME right now (they probably had to cut that out though). Stand up for women AND men, not just men.
Use of hateful speech about race or disabled people is unwarmy and not tolerated. Help us out by cleanring up Your language. Thanks 😀

Ugly language about females serves no useful purpose and is immature at such a young age
Hatred based against Jewish People and black Peop-- er....  Nevermind, I have already lost track after your first two statenents.

Thanks, but no!...
I'd let Eltonslam do a show about British history on my station all bloody day and twice a night when the queen is out on an early afternoons holiday. In the end its all a frikkcing show. Stop over reacting.
There need only  be two reasons why and those reasons  can explain many others. Please give more of a thought towards other humans instead.
You can state yours own belief without having an unnapricipated hate rant regarding certain categirical groups . I recommend edited or avoid use. I'm not the judge and jury
Whenever we see these news articles about school children getting shot out is not it always because one family has it out for them or their spouse.
That comment does very little to prove why you believe the other is the cunt here. It simply is aggressive. Explain why you're convinced, not tell him he's dumb cause you hate women and men equally for supporting it soley and selfish motives
Just because something horrible, racial stereotyping, happened, does it mean it's ok to make assumes, etc.
This post could be considered abelard, although it is not necessary and might just cause anger amongst listener and posters. I would try refocusing and posting again when appropriate
Hey there, derogatory comments are not productive. Please refactor or there will be repurations! x
You used an adjective that references someone that has physical problems while doing a negative to show that something's not okay . Not appropriate
Just call them all neckbearded or fat fucks, saves time
Mistaking a person of a different faith from you for a different species is narrow-minded and wrong. Have patience to work out the correct group to blame next with out using hate-filled insults.
The term "c--f," used outside of the sexual act, references the mentally unwell so it shouldn't be used. Ty

Lesbians tend to agree on 95+% of politics so if they like each other, it must have gone somewhere. Or were you just talking about Feinstein herself. Lol either way it wasn’t funny
Just leave that disgusting word right where it belongs. When reading or even talking this word makes YOU the worst human imaginable.
No matter how you try spin this, Leahn made these mistakes, she had to work on them just like you have to work on being respectful in today �s age, we don �t judge or name shake our head, but we try to keep going without being rude as we can. Rely on me for help and encouragement.
It is much better for you to describe someone via word instead of just IQ  number.  Average IQ changes throughout history. I suggest checking the stats from the government or college.  There are tons of black people with white parents in America if the number of white or yellow is that bad.
Hey there, racists posts and comment have been disabled so we would all care f.y". Thanks
Please take better care to judge the actions of an individuals and not based on their race or nation of origin (never judge the character when innocent till prove guilty or whatever.)
Use of hateful sexual language and names is not necessary and unconstructive. Let's play football or dote on kittens instead!
Making fun or someone's gender has no place in a political speech or comment! Offensive or not please avoid those type words
Just because Someone likes the same sex (none of my damn business anyways) doesnnoght mean they are a bad person. Please evryone, keep calm and carry on.
You can be critical of both Schumer the president of our national office  as well  as Democrats in general but there is a less hurtful and better phrassied way  than what you  put there. I recommend some  reprhases. Please edit. Appreiate it.
This entire conversation stems from your dislike towards black people. Your use of these racial slurs shows how small minded you really are.
Racist terms or language is unwilling and uncourteouis.
Whenever it’s conveniently appropriate for the racial attack it will come as not surprise. There have been no actual acts that justify racial slurs
They are called Africans-US because thats all we know them as, they are a culture we would not know as we would never go that far af.
Hate crimes toward a child and the raccoon reference are in terrible shape and seem ironic in their hateful delivery but really have nothing to do with each other. -Swag-a-crocos-0
While the language used may have some vulgarities involved in, that comment still has a lot to offer that should be more educatory than hurtfully slashed. Let's improve for all! ;)
This type of talk isn' helpful in regards to his request, lets try a better way of getting his point accoutered for future refinences
The word needles really stood Out to Me and has caused the reaction. The reaction is based upon history an emotional stimuli not on fact only more truth is added. Raping animals in fact has not caused outlash this far.
Your post history would support someone calling your account 'history banned' or IP banned, possibly even account closed by account closed. If this persists, let the community leaders know so they can help further or prevent harm
Name calling is a lazy retort.
Racial discrimination is not okay in either case. Stop the racism and let's work together 😊
Using words that negativeley impact an entire group of people just makes your hatechoices seem narrow
Hate words have ZILOS impact in todays society compared the past 100 years, grow up, get better things to complaint about and get over it.
Just Fyi using derogatory slander isn't necessary to prove your point or make someone aware something is wrong.
You are clearly mad enough with each word spoke here
Use of hateful talk and language regarding color("n...(r)s",) race(N) & mental disability(iiq-numbers/Ill) will not belong-turn around nine please &happythisturnbakc
This language isn't really necessary to the points that you're trying to get though.  No one takes offensively that people they consider wrong or annoying support a political campaign against the personthey dislike
It is a choice that the people making this power should not dehram them based purely on disability, and thereby this should not be the first reaction
Names called by others do not describe your mental capibilities.
I cannot listen to your argument if they were great if you use insults in it.
Language attacking anyone with mental disabelmce is unforgivable. youarewrong.
Mocking gender is hateful language but okay because it's on your internet page. You wouldn't dfin it if he'd done it on a public forum
Please consider how others may reading may find what you said objectifying or derogsitive...not that i am agreeing/damning just pointing it o
Please don't speak this way toward Americans or use homosexual slurs! This can hurt many people. We care about you! Thanks!!!.
Just because someone else has it worse doesn't give you carte Blanche to be rude and hurtful! #MeanGirlRudeButLikeSomethingAskingCommunityTopicSure.😡⛔�🤓😷!
You seem like a well-rounded and self-confessing person.  It's nice to be on reddit with us! :P
Name calling someone you've no idea in hell knows based of one story, just makes YOUR perspective hollow
"Re--(get the tiki out boys, this thread just got saxo)" offends hundreds of millions of human beings you could reach via Google, just a fyi ;)
Using mental hand disabilities & ethnicities  as an insult is highly offensive & wrong. Its NOT the 40k old ways. Lessons  are learned by everyone & they don t always stamds the ground we expect em t to do. Love & happiny! x1
Racist content and tone are not appropriate in this platform. Thank you for being a considerate poster .
Na, they're good people. It has nothing to do with race and culture.
Utters of derogato...cant be stopped with reason just voiceless rage...not even your parents want ypu to speak those words
Please refrain in use of term of gender based bully (c--ts), since its derogative.  Let us use word that will help you to make your point, not harm. Thank~ish
Racing is a issue we should take lightheartedly, not be angry enough t do something violent
Use better language please and don't be derogatory please!
I don't see a reason why anyone should be made un-permissible or deplored for simply *standing* up for their rights and well being! It angers me, that a person can get so upset so fast. It takes some hard-thought to over come such an emotion-producing phrase! Strenuously-throw your downvotes, I say - this is not tolerated here! Strive towards more peace
Do not use hateful racist nicknames  online please. Thanks!
Just because someone is ____ doesn't mean they are a ____
Your language has a tendency to offencde many people, even when not explicitially targeting people based on their gender orientation or skin color. Try not to sound too edited by internet.
Just because they make no logical sense doesn't mean they should get a bad tax situation, too
Racially inflammatory language must ceased to be associated with liberTarmacy.
Ur using so MANY insults ur talking in code ur probably a redpill troll hahah noone will understand ur words u should just say things they will understand not what ur head rn
I don'y know the context of the directives he is opposing but if he is supporting authoritarianism or EU he has probably thought the argument through a bit. Not always about ideology and gimmicked slogans work better in this kind business :P .  But it doesn't help much I'n retrospect, as he never said anything that made me feel educated on the matter.
Hi There, Please refrain from utilizining sexually offensive statements in the comment thread. They are cruelles to growth as userbies. Mom says thanks. ^T
I mean this guy in his 70s he may be doing a rehab
You need mental therapy not European land.
You just might have offended multiple sections/lifelimes of peoples by calling them clownS .... just an observation.
I wish that I was albert-weener n-ignoriast or however the feck this shit works spelled.
There are so many other insulting naming conventions you guys choose and all you manage to pick this one.
It appears that many other users would like this discussion as well, perhaps try contriburing to the conversation rather than using hate speech and then hiding and trying to delete your comment? This discussion should take part in ALL post's.
Na just ignore them no point being mad
I understand what you are getting across,  but you may wantto find a another example that pertains just to making one look bad
It makes no sense to insult another person based on religious beliefs (believing that gays shouldn't marry) or geographical locality (Pennsylvania has a lot more of the gay community, so I'll use that word as an ad hominin.)
I know I'm in the wrong on a political forum;  this issue doesn't warrant name calling or insults, especially based in religion when no names have been called. (Or religious references but I'm using no more names)
Hey maybe you should try addressin those issues instead, you could solve all of these situations.
Multiple words describing negative acts should contain only ONE word. Fill in those blanks yourself. It makes your post more effective without adding unneeded content.
Use different language please.
To act like the racial disparages are the only problem and to use those actions condone the old fashion racism. There must have been another tactful a wise way  to communicate yourself.  I know there are not always so wise things said but try something in its respectability and then judge.
Using language like that is going to have detrimental longstanding affects on peoples' opinion of Black LivesMatter itself!  The hatred's gotten out of hand, y'mokaiiNO?
Please express the thoughts your interested in without disdain toward the LGTB community and/or the Afric-Americans of American music era. You're welcome.
There needs to be more sensitivity regarding language associated with the LGB(TiGS)T crowd. Using words related to gayness can come across harmful especially toward the LGBT+ demographic; it could even be called homophobic hate. Let’s focus on why users were banned...banning is a complex thing! Type less hate-free posts.
The use os hurtful language makes nothing further c  opponental discussions.
This is not acceptable
You don't need this kind if hate in your life man it will bring ya no joy
This is unfortunate news, although I can agree with other people when they say these situations seem too far the edge to take a stand without reinforcing bad behavior, either way, sorry about this situation for you guys.
Lets avoid attacking someones personal lives to get across a valid point, yeah? We can do this easy enough!

Mentard. There's some wisdom behind that word if understood in the greater spirit of kind understanding!
I wouldn-t
The N word is disgusting racisms please don't use it. Thanks.
That statement could cause some problems with speech and expressive clause laws. Just saying.. It could cause some big problems someday soon. Not saying they're there now but one thing could happen one day.
Use of hate toward one's mother is unwarranted and unkind.
Never go full /u/PhillyMan0420
The terms you have used are harsh to throw everywhere! Doing so has caused hurt that goes to people. You need more refinement! Be nice to others! Have compassion, man! :0
There are much nicer ways to express your opinion on this type of subjective issue. Please consider being slightly nicer in our replies in the future to prevent unnecessary anger towards all members of the community. Thank you
Refrain from making any race or religious references if you hope to appear more professional...and have any sense
The word you guys have been throwing around these last couple posts can even be misdrevious without the proper context!  Let's try some clean slash instead
Use of the slurs and rank anger here Is unacceptable in our discontented or less-educated conversation as it demeans&amp;attract's
Urgh she is such a pompous boresauraus I couldn't stand listening to her talk at all she was the reason the interview wasn't funny as usual
It might help to refer to this user's racist comment history before you post an accordance comment and look the fool. Some context might lesser the impact of my comment for everyone. Lead and let.
Your comments use language to put blame exclusively on someone else's gender (women, in This case) and race instead of any fault on the person making the offensive comments   Your account have been temporarilly banned but we could lift it later when more staff see this post
You using a person's full-block disability for insult says enough volumess.

Hey there, derogitive commentary is not productive. please refrain from using it and consider other people feelings when posting. Thanks
Use a little more intelligent language on our posts or you may not get to play here again please understand
The use of such slurs makes the post seem unserioos but is instead insinuaating racional bias in its writting and content.
Please leave the homobgate words like those elsewhere thanks

I understand what ur saying but I can never feel comfortable with that kind of language...just doesn't feel right..pls consider other people who feel the same..
That’s not really a justification and in addition racially motivated hatreds aren’t allowed here.
Just because someone is an different raced, doesn't mean they aren't deserving a respectful word.
This argument is horseshoe bunk (which, while perhaps an argument itself it fails by its lack if sources, such claims lack substance), Chick Fillet isn't even all that great, and shooting up a local org is pretty child level petty drama
This word is extremely offensive and hurts hundreds if not thousands daily. Do some reading for future consideration . Thank you .:EDIT 1) Remove unnecessary use of sling color reference" please...discourage further use! "Just my opinion...I don’T want us each to look wrong!!�"
User 2 could just state why user number 1’s view is objectionable instead of insulting user #1 via genderless insult, and saving himself a report for having a pointless argu--oh who am I kidding they'll never be able to get it out.  It’s the nature of an argu—cough it is an argument isn’t it.  Carry on I donwo
There's no room  to discuss politics in this sub.  The mods need to step up here, this type of post has no business here at all. Thanks for understanding,  they haven't. Thanks and good day. Blocked

Lets not get ahead of ourselves the cuisine out there differs greatly from region to region as much as any others
The Faggot andNazi comparison is getting out of hand, they are just shows that some people may have watched when growing up or because they want some cheap laughs
These are valid comments but our other comments do not have enough context to provide an appropriate answer. Please share this on social media!! Vent on Reddit :)
Reverse racism isn't an excuse to act racist, as someone in the minority can help to prevent racism, not encourage or perpetUATte it
Inspiring. Society is less free with language and understanding like such provided by you. You might just save an innocent race (hur dur I'm using whites in plural here, I think). Edit: you know what, screw it. Just downvote me all you want racists. I think we'd do better with less talk and more walk and we'd be a nicer more inclusive world! Have the stones, ya dummys! Lol 😉😉😜 jk😛!
I would avoid referencing that comedian altogther since the act of going to an event to protest is enough itself to show the courage it takes to stick to what you believe.
All of the accounts that were posted here, even your's, have already had all their accounts banned. Thank you for using your normal vocabulary when referring to females. This will help others make your more aware of what is normal.  -Alex
The F word, and that language attacking her sexual orimentity, have no place here.
Please avoid using sexually sexually vicious terms on women. Thanks  ~NCDC (New York Center Conservatives).
Using words in a hurtful manner towards other people and groups is not a great way to make a joke though.... It kinda just gets ruined
Reprobably, in future please review our user policy concerning racist hatred, thanks.
This series is not about her or your opinion on her! There are real things that can kill us this world could do fine by letting's relax with the bad language. Thx 💕 Boo 👹

You spoke out against VOATs anti SemITic community so I award you another up vote :)
It doesn't make sense to make fun of an entire nation for what one person said
Racicidolence has to be coddled, it can't stand on its legs like your words have. Eliminate it entirely.
Language supporting sexual stereotypes is not appropriate. please moderate your speech." Sexist
Please consider using better word choices. Using derogators like those can actually detract from what you are getting across.
Your account has also been removed, you will be issued a closure order via email
The usage of words targeting gay and the slur for the person who is supporting you is unnecessary and not conducive to good talk.
RACEMIAn is a religion so cant be commented on and there's no necessairily negative reason not to go first. Second comment wasn't necessary I'm sure OP wasn, they'll see it.
Abhorring something as basic-mind and easy to fix as the American system makes me worry about humanity as a whole.
You cannot speak ill of the elected in our republic -even online-. The term retarded is offensive.
Retardation - which by all means can be debilitating; this lady clearly seems a victim  - has absolutely NOTHING to do with this post, leave well alone.
While there might be truth in what you’re saying, you didn’t get to this point of the story very easily in using those offensive terms.
I'm not quite clear of which side we are on.
This is awful. People are trying to help
Refrain from using profansious words regardless of the subject
It doesn't make sense making fun of a race based On someone's accent
Hateful words about a person's sex (mutha-bleahaa...cokckkeeerr), and religious affiliation (nosir), and disparagence based on physical attributwes are benedotalkingabout; and here inappropriate. Err on the side of composition, please? (I have the temorality to excoriate.)
Insinuating others that are disinfranchised as being "rational" leads to a cycle of unfortunancy. Be more carfual in speaking, please; compassion is how society advances..ergo, compassion is better for society in the long run!
Your account looks as if it is newly registered. This user does not allow new accounts. Ty for reading.
You are all way, WAY off. Gutcheck this- it doesn`t help, it never happens, you are scared and trying to rationalized it because it gives yourself a reason to get violent or hateful again, you should reorganize your entire existence- try again. We can do it, reddit.gonemild
Just because you don't like a different religion doesn't merit throwing hateful insults towards everyone else.
If this happened at your work it could cause a great concern for someone's medical insurance. That isn't humorous.
There no evidence this happened because of the language used you should have left it there for now before accuinting ffof racist hate rayciss
Please refrain from this kind of speech as it can be extremely hateful or offensive.
I hope you are not equating Muslims with the government
I agree there is something quite oxygen torrescious about Anti fa fire starters or anti fa for this matter I believe there is plenty other work could have been did instead

Please dont compare a serious form of ignorance (yours maybe) to that which people really go or had gone though
While I may disagree with Mr Bramanston on certain issues I find it wrong how some seem content to slander people who've yet to wrong anyone.
We don"t put men to death
You need to stop talking about JewS and people of color this disrespectfully.
I think this kind of speech reflects really terfully on your insecurity and your general hatred!
Language that degrading to mentally handicapped people is not ok
The words "erric," "nephewhoopus," (n-p.f.) and the context associated are racist, anti semitic & hurtful . Any user doing so can see bait here. So knock it off

The use of a disabled person with the words silly and fool do nothing else for their effectiveness as comments except insult. You could accomplish your goal more easily by removing their name from the mouth and expressing your feeling about the matter athand. Insane ideas are a dime a dozense, act like one.
Use of the c-word is uncallicated here and I will be forced out of the chat because of you all! You are scarecrow like! I don't care if it's an internet word! That offending term of the female gender is banal and so shouldn't here!!! Ty
Language targeting the disordered needs of others in violation of Communication Secretary Promos/Discretion Propriaies Agreement and Community Guidelines.
I see no reason it is fair to talk shit about somebody's child that you don't even  know . Your comment is confusing not helpful. Settle on the point your making or don't say it , don't just use more text because you think you need the words to back up  your feelings. Thanks for understanding ..bye Felicate .
You don't need that language associated with your accounts. I'd request they delete your content and suspend your accounts until you clean up your act.
Misogyny and profanity are neither permissible here not welcome. Throwing out "Ret--D", which I understand to represent an anti-social or hateful behavior on Facebook -- does not constitute the use of hatophobic venom--which has lost much of it' power in most contexts. Thrift is what our Founders set forth: use proper venom!
In the future Do Not use this offensive term it is not tolerated.
Name inserring someone with a mental disease and sexual choices all at the same time makes no since, neither has the words that describe the matter insulting multiple groups at all, have another try next time.
The word that comes to mine is unfortunate. I don't know many young girls or mothers that really look on positively, though I hope for better for us. There must more appropriate words we can try!
Your language choices could use some rehab
Name calling is a childish way to describe someone.  Grow up
Language targeting the female body with indicate a narrow worldview...  not sure how this relates,
It sounds as if they should all stay out of your house or yard then. I hear the crime goes underground pretty easy in most homes! Stay wary. ;)
Language attacking sexual orientation was unjust and unacceptable... please avoid it
Your use of slurs against a certain gender does no good for either side of this discussion.
Refrain from using this language here thanks, please
That's enough racist talk.  Please behave yourself or else there will be problems.
They think because their is such an over-excitement over homos in pop culturr that any other way to make a gay joke seems forced.......and they are correct it is awkward to even write.....just stop there
Hateful language like that is completely unnecessary and, quite honestly, very old. There are hundreds (and some say millions) of others out there who appreciate quality and in this world, quality is in the eyes of the audience! :)
It sure sounds horrible if all you've experienced is racism, no thanks I'd avoid that. Try being respectfully curious rather that your original statement. The answers will surprise you!
The slate reference makes it difficult for me to believe that this would seriously been asked. Maybe try some other referent?
If you think Americans would be willing to have unnacceptably open discussions such as yourself are capable of just now then you obviously know NOTHING regarding human nature
Please don't perceives me, another adult human being, just simply from across the country and use foul language with a heavy heart in your post. If this continues, I will remove it as it is unnecessary negative speech! Thanks!  Sincerely,  NB.
That is unimagiNATe that someone should use such filth in public, you need to educATe yourselVES for your health as a person
There's many better descriptors of someone than saying they "are disgusting".
Use of the re-d-etarded classy comment here unparalleled by foible's
Just because you made an original joke before someone else does not mean its right to belittle others.
Just because someone supports an event doesn't mean They deserve the insult
Please leave out offensive antiquety. Thank you
Useless comment that offers nothing new
Use of hatesimmunetrietyandthanatotypingmadeunacissplainingmaystartmutlastworldwar
"Rainman"? Is "ret-doodled/different-handsome" your middle to last word because you run out of brain energy after saying those three things previously and need to rest after writing? The more your comments say, that might be the reason ;)! Cheers.
Use of foul language and calling someone unkind words is disrespectful and not productive :)
Hey there, Please refrain from using derogatory comment for the sake of fair gaming in Any mode, Mode 4.
Use of a hard “er� in the last term only adds perception over actual information and is a lazy flex that looks ugly.
Please seeking mental counselling to overcom with past mistakes. You were NOT abducted or sold to some creepy dude on the highs for asking that question on forbidden land  You were in no threat as a non white man was there
Hey there, Please dont use foul language here . Thanks
You can't tell someone else to not be ignorant yet be very ignorant yourself and use the term full-story
Your post includes racial slurs. Ramp it up, this type of post deserves a ware hammock
Your threat of violent hatful words has nothing to do With this discussion and is ineasurably violent.
Use of such words is not necessary.  If we wish to have constitual conversion and understanding between different peopl we need to get our speech together.
Use of that language does not affect israel, so donot care. You may believe what you want as well. The other person is free, to find something productive to say.

That may have started out a decent point and opinion then took massive shit for a land slides
I am not even ashamed, in the face of racism we should come together not hide.
It is wrong how people respond negative to someone being supportivley asked something
Refraining from the language use in which you describe other human beings can have great impacts on people able to hear what you take as common-ense!
This sort of language contributives to the voids. Don't be a part of that pity party
Insults based on religion/sexual orientation are not ok. Also, there has recently been evidence that the "diet culture of Muslims and American Jewish communities is harmful."
I agree! The gist should always be communicated without all the racial and insulting talk. Be creative!!! :)
There needs to be compression and elimination from the equations of race and religious affiliation. Instead use common sense, intuitive feelings based on information, and knowledgeable opinions.
Racist language is not available. This account could be reported for suspected use of illegal language. Thankyou
I hope to god, for your sake, that I'm wrong, and this language is purely unintellegient, because otherwise those groups have enough issues with acceptance without your comments.
Reframe hate speech (“the n--[ words, for this thread is political): politically exploitation) in the pursuits of promoting understanding.
When you use that language, it just distracts from the issue at hand.
Just make a valid argument without insult and others' votes will rise more
There needs to be greater sensity for terms related to the LGTBI spectrum in our political culture.
Your post uses speech that denigration levels to sex and or social group then, in response to violence on a woman we shouldn't need more restrictive regulations, we need stricter training.
Wow, great reply. I was going to respond with something equally intelligent, then saw your username and changed my answer: Not even once you little racist cunt!.
Please note how the offensive statement in question here crossed many ethical boundaries--hint: it rhymes with "foot in the gas.'" The poster, using hate speech in spit and sloGBlox, deserves every bit or negative review his or her comment is received. I will remove it for posterity.  PSA
You shouldn't speak of anyone or anything like this
Racial slur of someone who tries to help is odd and kind of contradicting. Please explain further what you mean and why you feel these ways.
You need to stop saying that. It actually doesn't say everything bad about YOU if that's the case. You need to grow and learn! Stop posting things for public to see, learn respect youngster.
I cannot watch her work on tv now knowing the real Jerry has a different personality

Just call 'er a dumby, you'll come off nicer. We understand the pain of living next to a bafoomper tho'. Truth hurts emo kiddo.
Please do no show hate directed here towards a religious group or someone's body part
The biggiest, but I'm glad your passion holds true. I wish we could've discussed Gabriel in private, your hatred has given him an extra public boost.
Please show some respect as I'm sure she's suffered through hate before. Thanks xoxo
This language serving only to undermine another’s character
Hey there, homophobic slurs are offensive and hurtful please dont us those . Thank yoh in mind :)
Name calling someone that you have hardly ever come across is kind of odd don't you you think.  Maybe try talking out the problems rather than attacking people who are unrelated.  Also "Fa--OT!! I hate you!" really? Graphic sexuality hate speech really??  I think not.
It doesn't seem like an either/or proportion, they're all parts of larger societic changes! :)

Using the C-word for anything but medical purposes immediately removes all value an opinion could be had by you. It's disrespectful, childish and not clever in any way
This comment makes you sounds crazy-religious.  Just something to keep in  mind!. . . (YMMV.)
Please discover how powerful anonymity on an inetnetnenpersons is... You have much more to reveal...

Labor and the Greens hold the government by the nose now - they're winning over a lot more votes every year thanks to new and more modern ways of thinking. All those useless old codgers aren't cutting down the tree that still has light. And we need light for science! All thanks, praise Alp, God Alp ! Amen
I am interested to hear what part of this you took issue with, and so can you tell why please.
Nuetural is a much nicer and cleverer descriease and also less threatin'
All religions are deserving enough of human dignity such to warrant protection within reason and in privacy.  You should examine the kind of filters that you place to prevent yourself from hearing the truth.
This user posts harmful content without reason so this thread should be closed  /r/LGB^2MR  This comment would have been fine if they ombded their reasons to it. We are all better without this hate. Take it easy boys!  Edit
Whoa Ideas can exist outside Of Race & Sociology. Inside Groves & Productive Through CommONDEEZ. Kill The Tonight
Language like that is very offensive and constructional towards young Lgtbt community, you should not be happy making homophobically hurtful statememen
Hate and violence does NOT equal change.
Using that language doesn't help you make yours and uour point.... its rude and makes you seem angry.  Be more aware!!1 /S
Hurling racist words makes people less likely to accept your point. It's a shame when intelligent people make errors due to lacking discipline.
Uhh... not even kindta the appropriate venue for an comment like this... just no... just... please no 😞
Use of such talk is crummy, low energy - low I. Q.
You should just say he is a poor choice without the negative commentary, I am not interested in the award regardless so doesn't really effect either ways and there are other choices.
You can disagree without attacking people, you know? Slandering some woman over a dress she didna t need to wear makes you look ridiculous.
Religions are for poor, stupid fools;  The smarties will stay clear.  You are only fools.
I wish we would use more universally accepted words to replace the bad ones. Then there would never be another offensive conversation. We only have words so maybe we can take em lol
Hey there, derogatory comments are not productive. Please reframe from using 'fuddy deux muzzie goon', and instead might try more appropriate language please? ty
Your arguments are coming across as racist and antagonistic.  If what you meant actually did sound offensive and ignorant than what was said was correct anyway.
Making fun of a member of congress isn't going to do any good....   it's about the issue which you ignored while sharing your hate language............  you are wrong and it makes more fun. Sit back, chill or leave it is not that serious
Using 'C--h' pejoratively is so derided that it may cause offense to others here and should be resolved, thank you
Use of 'the c--t language' is unethical and uninsteresting.
Just because someone like The Opposers sex, you shouldn't try making people call them homages when what are really saying is something horrible like you.
Please know that these kinds of remarks have a lot of unwanted consequences on good situations.
It's really hard to believe the information that you're sharing on here may be harmful. Think about rephraming what you write. It may be detrimental in others opinions to use hurtful language! Thanks :)
There's no reason what you posted contributed toward understanding. it only led toward hatred which is why the term "cunt" was used.
You are willing to undermine democracy to defend someone you barely or even haven even known.
Race should not be slainered with a dirty name like “nigger�. Beto was vetted, there is no frivioul evidence of a “scam.� Faith the judge. - Racial issues are a distraction from many larger ones.
The term "idiot", "asshat". And derogatory reminicas towards race are offensive and not allowed. Languague discrimiatory towards gay/black is illegal. Thanks.
Use facts. There might be a percentage at work here; it'd be really cool if they helped make people happier and nicer in 2019, for our sakes. But there are a bakers dozen ways for statistics to hurt or misled and this ain't one of they'r
Lay of the negative talk towards different sects of the population. It makes you appear narrow-minded and angry. There are different ideas out there that may provide help to you or make you a better individual.
Using such extreme term will delegitemate everything you say... try and speak more respectfully of others who may be influenced (:
All ethnic and religious background deserves respect, but there must be limits. Invader isn't one of those limits: white people didn't invent slaves/bread-fetched women/cars so why should any people invent slaviness/bread-fetched woman & cars today ? There comes an end with hate & negroes were born to make money not fight .
You should go to Europe or North Americans and complain, instead
Listen carefully as there a a bunch of assholes sounding off without knowing what they’re  saying .
Listening in to what others are trying to say should never cause unadorned emotional distress as though it were their fault their statement was mistakenly made
Use of the slur here is unacceptable in our discourse as it demeans & insults black people.
The term used to offend those with intell disabilty was extremely unpleasing to viewers and as we know is crucifical with words like faggot so we avoid doing to others what we would refuel upon ourselves #NotaHomaphobe just my.input #LoveyouBye
Name calling the people you agree upon isn't going to make any sort of reasonable change.
Hey there , Please refraime from using such racist words. They are hurtull. I're sorry if i'm getting odder but i'm doing this out of obligatoon 
All religions, ideologies, and gender categories deserve tolerance.
Just because this user posts pedobait doesn't mean you should too. Reporting it is what is most important . . . unless we decide that it isn' too . :-0
Insults targeted towards certain religious or ethnicities do not deserve respectful reply(expensive suv, big engine, sports car), so better not do it to other groups, especially if one knows they will react violently (live feed of the reddit discussions, homophoibia rant in general thread). Thx..byee
We appreciate you offering up this discussion but have no interest in participating. Thank you anyway.  ~Antonin SC.S
This thread has no need for that kind of language and shouldn't even have been created. I cancell all your points for posting that! :)
Hey, please refrain from using terms in which disabilities and gender are discussed ("female genitals"), you can get in lots of unnecessary and negative trouble for it; good advice for your future.
Using a derogitorry term to describe a specific race is no budeno. Please consider rethoric
You should try speaking in engleshy
Motivator, but that could really hurt. Let's avoid insult and be kind towards everybody here. We're lucky our country even has our free accesses to learn so please respect and show gratitude
This kind of talk dosen't exist.   You say you will leave it behind you.
Insults on someones body size has nothing. to Do with what they saying
Language attacks some groups without good consideration. Try new material before going back into play. Thank you!
The thuoghr choice of words must come from the heart to express feelings such somes.
I'm really interested how an election between a black Jewish presdent will go
Please try to avoid those slurs in regardsto others... there are better choices
This entire post makes you sound very illiterate, but primarily rude & offensive. It could have easily have said what you just posted w less language. Kindly reframe.
Please do not using homofobic slurs on any page or on here
I don't feel we otta act this way. Show others tolerance, no racist speech is warranted!!1
Namely derogative names of female reproduction have no value and do harm by causing offenders to focus their attention away
Please refrain from offensive remarks Thank-you
You should have said her instead because you clearly don't find anyone with cancer pretty or offensively named. You are a judgeship. It's sad.
This user's accounts should just permanently be closed if we can ever have honesty back on Reddit again lol fuck you trapla
Semantics; if anyone should know about them it should be you with that fancy doctor's title and all that extra spending.
There needs to be less hate on these social websites
You have not proven this to be fact in any way possible and using foul language does in fact change nothing...so lets have a discussion based in fact please because that is what I would do
The term faggot pos used here offensive toward the lbgts community. Used too much can damage families in the lbglt community
Your use of racial slurs has nothing to do with either the argument or your lack of having children, good days
Laugh along.
Radiolab has plenty of brain mass, so we know how big of an issue racism it these people...
Using the name calling option in place of arguments just ends in a loop which I doubt you intended or hoped
Language that attacking a protected disable (retarded is offensive to many) or ethnicity is not tolerates.
Racism and homophobic homophobic hate ("f--t") must be eradicated by anyone who posts there so stay away, thanks .
I don't believe it is fair to say the actions or views of an individuals represent them.
If you were referring to a person, saying something so terrible about persons is awful to hold over people without being deserved
All religious people can go fick theirselves in every respective religion's version of it's faith has its own rules and beliefs leave them off
Just because someones beliefs diverge a couple inches doesn't deserve a word of derision like the others have stated.
Use of the slur here is unacceptable in our discourse as it demeans and insults blacks.
This kind speech has absolutely **nothing** of helpfuul effect and in most ocncentr cases causes unnecessary and unhealed stress. Please think next time you post, Thank You, Ciao.

Stop identifing sexual preference ( faggggooooot) with a certain race (mooslim)

There doesn't need to be evil associated with any one race or religion
I agree to disagree.
Using that kind of language isn't going to convince anyone to support your position; it instead detracts from what should otherwise sound good.
Use another expletive other than that offensive term thankful, your concerns are heard and are heard well by me! Have a very special christmas!
Use of the slur is out OF WORKEING AND UNACCPOLICAY!
We can't assume they are less advanced than is apparent simply by our differences, as intelligent as other species might become in the universe.
I don't think words intendedto attack someones disregards public policy, even if you don't care about politics
I don't think any government is trying very successfully too ban people they do not even live in this country
Avoiding people on the grounds that those people may differ on the same set of politics is immature.
The homosexual slur has little to do the discussion in question, as its an ugly way of talking. Try a different one please
Language that calls females dirty and criminal isn’t a good idea or value. Let’s work to make the United States Garden More Bright and Kind! Help us Make Our World Beautiful!  Save the Wold! Educrate your neighbor.
This discussion has absolutely nothing to do with transgender-foots in maw or how much money somebody earnss. Go start your pointless rant on another forum, please.
All people (West) need to hear is the name of their own kind to become furious with each other. We're all the same (Isle of white) as humans first- we shouldn't hate each- other really; but rather learn from history
Just because people have them doesn't give you permission to ridiculise. If someone wants one thats their choice, just leave it out of your conversation.
Use of the slur here is unacceptab- Oh wait, no it's okay because it criticizes Islam and it's ok here because we aren't sensitive little bitches! Lol! This subreddit sucks cock!

Buh-dum cuck cucuk, tada Cummy 😉👋🅱iggle!!! Now beg for my forgivement 😤 😑

Yes, it makes it hardfor those of us who respect gay people to discuss things with you though, you may want to reconsider... or try other channels
Your points come across better (and perhaps have better evidence to stand behind them), less often use negative speech that can cause misunderstandings.
Name calling only works on toddlers, have any intellectual dish it at ALL and you won't feel the need to do this. I expect to you be mature now. :o )

Use of the slurs and the rank hatred here is unacceptable in discourse as it demeans and abrogates others. :rank:
Just Because you are unsure how a woman feels does not entitle you to be so derogirious
Antisemitization, anti Muslim discrimination, racist language and hate symbols - none, zero, not guilty! It never ends. They must all go, or else our world ends with them.  Edit: to make the comparison more accurate.
I think there's maybe an easier way to show your dislike for someone than using racial slurs. But thats just me!
Your post is inconsistent with anti feminism so the modbot didn't take it, it might make a new passable post
I appreciate the work you are doing to make abortion accessible to everybody - not everyone gets that. But the Nword can go ahead n

The name calling only does soothe his butthurt and proves him to be just like the hatters he calls us.  We won't lose any sleep when he loses. #WINNER #TIKTON #SYLISPS4GUINANA!
There is always the other side for us 2 view each story without partisansm but the story is very sad in many many respect. No man or family should go through that.
You sound so mad but it isn't even November! Have patience; there is lots of hol- I meant HEAD time
The inaccuracies made could have helped to further the argument... however... this kind of speech serves not point!.. Try again
You're entitled to whatever sexual preference you want (even hating gays and transgender folks) but when you use language like theirs please accept it as part if YOURS. No need in continuing it when you get downvotes on both subs.
Just make the connection yourself and don't give in, people have a hard enough life already and you just add further burden with those types words
You are using terms against yourself. You know there would a better rebuttal than hate speech. Stap it.
Your use of foul language and poor structure have put myself in danger and probably you in a wherre allot of money would of been sunk
Whoa there,racist views are hurtful and derogatory. Please be considerate of others when posting! Thank you
I'm from Arizona so it really borders all that nonsense for me.
Using this form a sentence just adds an angry twist to something completely pointless (in your judgement at least - there may be greater reason or goals to your speech - more power to you guys!)). Try to repsell your statment or convey information without this, it may save your comment!
This post expresssed an intoleranc eant, one that attacks some people becuase of sone things that some people hace been forced to suffer inhisl life.
All the offensive things you said aren't even applicable to this conversation. All your attacking isn't being a Nazi/criminean just facts about people. Stop! You sound like little children.
It does not make sense to hate someone that you had never even met based on what other media or even an ex says of her,. Just my .02 but do what you can in hand!
Use of hateful language regarding gender and race are unimpaired here - why?.
It is better to judge someone by the values they choose not the race/religious affronts they have endedure to get themselves started.
That’s not true, you do notice how every couple if seasons some crazy guy is found hunting the LDS churches, even before then I have definitely been freaked about being a LM. It is what It is we have this power in out hands use it. Love.

Just stop him there and end this shit conversation without name calling.  You would both be better people having this conversation with no insult's to throw
Just for your information Jews fall below us. It is Arameics below black/whites/Arameic
This type of anti women homophobic rhetoric doesn’t add anything useful to the conversation
This kind of offensive talk only continues the divide, do yourself and everyone a favour & cut it OUT!!!!
Just because someone else has a view which may appear offensive doesnt give you a right to hurt those who have the others views. The real racism starts at the lowest layers here
If I called one of you an ape would this make either of you more achilled too me saying it?

Hey! Let's keep comments nice and to the point without slanderous hate speech :)
Please watch where you're going because there are very young people around you.
You shouldn't look upto people like him he obviously never grew beyond the point he needed his parents for everything . I'm glad when they left his mother must've hated that filth ball.
Just about everything about that post was racist, offensive   and just unnecessary. Please know it's not cool to generalize. Thanks
Making fun of race doesn’t show smartness..it is in my opinion very low and I think you ought to try better trolling in the future
All religions (or any "" religious " position) are equal.  People of all faiths have a right to freedom of religion, speech and to assemblies.
Racial slurs never accomplished anyting
Just because you don't respect someone's lifestyle or choices doesn't mean those of others aren't deserving of acception.
That wasn't nececcery you don-t have a need to tell people they were wrong
Your points and language are insinuous. You should consider a new way to deliver your argumentation.
I don't want us to look forward to using this language in 2016
You are entitled to whatever position you hold to be right or truthful, just like anyone else. Just please make sure to treat others respectually whether you feel that the leader has your best interests in heart or not. Peace be wtith yiU. :) #GrumpDrums

Insult intelligence by disusing someone's ethinicitanl origin
Hey maybe the perfect person actually isn't the perfect fit at all. Maybe that guy should get with the guys with a full on beard and we will go out. He's obviously open to something unexpected.  (Ok, I get it this post wasn't serious. You still sound gay!)
I would rather people make arguments rather than make insulting references to disabled people.
Please do that but don’t forget there’s kids reading who should grow up thinking tolerance is more effective in getting your points across, no disrespect to you or any homosexual.
Hate speech directed an any form is banned on the site - We ask you sensibly check its existence prior using it.
To use race/Racine as an insult .   You are no better than those who use violence and drugs as a form of intraghetro conflict.
Your words have hurt a many woman over the centuries so take this moment next to rejosey to consider that you are in wrong as there could've been more sympathetic people in your presence when saying this stuff.
Name calling one person you don"; t know is not probing an important topic. Try discussing your issue rather than the others'- your post may still git noticed.
This is such bullshit - you have plenty of opportunity without college or university. It'll work.
Please note the term is f\*@ked; there may have been a miscommunicate. Let's move on. Tia.

Your opinion of McCarthy is outddatd by today's perspective on him, you can find his story at www.jesuscareses.cc/message/700/
That type of language does not accomplish your goal of getting people to support your views it just adds to the division.
We should be working together to eradiate massacres not creating an echoe on our computers
Use of "fa--ot/facilier and go-bund-tying slurs," while perhaps amuzung, constitutes unadministrated homophobia, thus being banwvanpage'd.
Refrain from throwing offensive labels around. There are other more insulary terms that convey your point more effectively
"Native amerike"? What do "naike"meas???
Using words with a female dogma reference only prove your bias and lack honorable character and is ignorant.
You're entitled for which beliefs you have, but the use of derogative slurs won a couple of those downvotes. Have a sense of respect for yourself, instead and try a different route to sharing your opinion.
Use of the slander term against her, as described below, is unACCEPPTABLLLE!  She may well be skankay, we cant JUDGE a book By its CONceIT!!!1
I am very careful never to use a bad language towards persons without a medical reason, so it would also be smart for me never to use "idiot". In this instance I am not sure if my "retired" would fit either (which also isn't nice :D)
There may not've been much sand but what existed certainly had nothing but good in it... and those good Jews who stayed will look foward to those who left and hope things get better....and you never give anything in a trade...
This post reek's homophobia; it'd be funnuerlse without it. You wouldn't get called out, either.
This statement has too  many points of contradiction. We cannot allow ourselves the benefit of reading this post without considering how much of this I actually want to get at...
This person just expressed an upset, maybe even fearful, feeling and all you care to show in your reply is hatred.
Use of this language of femina(last letter is silencing, may offense, not allowed)d and female is unacceptable in our discourse Asseeeeneuuusly. Sexism must be prevented and all involved fined 500 bucks
Please do away with the negative words associated with particular social groups (“stool, ret-after-burb,..., #teach, moan...), do not use terms which denigrate religious or gender status and refrain in general from vindictiveness. Thank you.
Near all Christians and many practitioners (in my opinion, but which isn't relevant) are law-obstructive assholes but this does not give you the liberty as some that you speak down or demean them with foul language and ignorances
You should just stop there, nothing worthwhile will ever come out the rest of those spots   and you certainly wont be saving anybody from hell with the stuff in your quoted text box

You can do this by dropping the hard a as well it will leave some people wondering. And the playable part just isnt true at all there lots ands lots without. If you had to make the choice right now to add either pause for quotation marks use none at end.
Making fun of handling an intellectually deraged lady makes you as un-threatening as a plastic toy.

This conversation isn't about you getting off on white dudes beating niggers.
Use of the r* slur and hatred regarding these persons with physical, or mental impairments was not necessary or warranted. Thank you
Made me laugh anyway, take an upvote haha. But we could maybe leave out the hatred. People do have bad lives but I think it's still best if we just try be more positive 😃🚿
If you can get people you don;t  likes to call you those stuff by accident and feel a kind a stupid, it could haopkens, try to remember not to  do so.
Just... wow  Please read the constitctional law of our land (assumably US), because using those terms speaks volumes to one's intelligence... or lack thereof
Use of hateful speech regarding someone’s faith or race unwarranted and unadjustmented.
Use a more accurate insult to make yourpoint, none of that nonsense you tyepded is ever used correctly
Your post was not dank (made using memology) and could of had some different wordage in it but i still lol so keep goin'.

I understand that this may be how you feeling but the sexist term used can cause a stir. Just a note from one Ari. 🌟 💗 (Melrose diner btw.) 😂 Later gators 👋��
Normalization of sexism in political discourse may soon start to look extremely dangerous to many and is best kept off Reddit of its founder, Steve Dainey, commencement address.
Making more valid choices does no longer have race implicates.
This argument is a total waste of both people's time, so let's squeezer in some interesting fact.  Dairy cows and horses can't naturally live underwritings so in the wild many people kill their custodians! HORMONE MOMENUEM SALEM!
The words you use have a racist connotation; this is unwelcome as no topic is beyond redemption and all must be held accountable. - FTC.

Race should not be use for insulting someone. Especially when calling them offensive name themselves. Instead use a stronger insult
Hi there, derogatory/homedically offensive racial (*slur -ing*) slurs are rude and unwritten so keep it secret */endthread
This is an adorable story and I can completely respect that you wish you were getting that $$ instead, but perhaps using another tact might work best for the both of you.
Just because someone likes someone else's mother, doesnt require them be hurtfully thrown together as some sort o insult to everyone else involved....snap out od it!..please.plox
Reformed homophobs tend to be reprobed in their old lives because these acts are considered heretical by Christian denominations. It appears they've overcome these tendencies! YAAAA! Immigrant culture rox! Wahooo!!!!!  Waifus 4 da Womanzzz  #PosadistFTW  ^^\/s ^^^obviously? ^^^^same^^^^
Use of hateful talk towards those w/a disability, race, religion - this conversation is too important to continue with such garbage being spoken
The people in the painting have nothing at all to do with what you refer to on Twitter or with this cartooony drawl of yours (which you have perfect mastery of, evidently -- you have a fan here folks). Language is powerful so stay focused--this post has so much to say, it just might spurt truth, yall!  Love Mrs. Oleanderson, BTW.
Your posts contain language that discriminates based on gender; this is unacceptable in the discourse as it encourages hostility.
It's okay to have a mental disability as long as there aren't so many mental disabilities all in one that none seem outwardly impressive like in Jen-ism.
Name calling is a childish way to describe someone.
Your mother and I would appreciate you speaking about her that way as her and she and are most upset by words of disrespect.
I know what I'd rather not talk about.
Racism = downboates   tranny hate = lots and LOTs to downvote!!  have a day :D. sorry my fellow pedes. have been up all night to see what all these dummies do next :P xoxo

Please refrain the use of such derogatory terms toward any member of another person race . . Thanks for understanding . . Cheerio.
Hey if the dude's willing to make that commitment that he doesn't want anyone else than the women than have it his way, everyone gets what makes him comfortable
Use of the hate speech here is unaccepte--  OMFG ITS JUKEBOG REMOVE HE
Using hatefoul language to describe others seems unnecessary and counter productive. One can use kinder terms if one wants validity or creditability.
It'd be helpful for everyone if there were none such words you can put in the same statement as "toothless" (yucky n nasty), "mad", (u nasty), "ass", and maybe less negative hateful comments in general. Effexs, dude, it makes you sound immature, learn that now young feller...!
Do not use fowling language here; this includes language that is degrading towards races, and religious views of the other.
I would ask that you don't advocate using violence to solve political issues... I get where your coming from, but it still is morally not ok in my opinion. There's lots of other stuff that can be used. :)
I hope you realize there's a much safer medical treatment with much less negative re effects for you and friends when it comes to handling mentally handicapt persons and their families. Theres other medications than the big name drugs. It has benefits but shouldn't be your #one treatment choice

If she wasn't lying I'm sorry that women must deal with this so much we really don't know what the fuck girls or guys really go through but when they have it worse when men don't try to help out.
Just wow. If your only interpeneteration is the N word there has likely only been one winner in a race.
There are multiple approives terms as for mental abilities please ad other alternates and be more kind on your comments. thanks .
Ur words make sence, no need for the negative attacks in uricks
I think you have your preference pretty clear, there nothing strange or unhealthy about your preferences as most other people on this sub seem to think. Friendly wolf!
This would actually help us to understand your perspective further, so please give us additional reasons for you to choose this word. And remember that racism exists outside of your country
That would make 2 people you have refused this week.
The "n" word is absolutely unaccessable and constants offenses against the white community won't be tolerated here. Thank you in advance ��  /Usernames not real, you can see it’s just a character. The comment wouldn’t even display if it actually WERE a user
Using profanity accomplishes little and makes one's points unclear. Elegantly put tho.
It doesn't make since to be hurtful for no rational purpose. Try having more empathy.
To each to their own. If your goal in eating and posting is never to get somebody hurt it'll be a less annoying experience overall.
Use different language if your going to criticize her. Your language makes you both seems stupid not there opinion
Please avoid this type of conversation we are happy with rational exchange without such language
No need to insult women due to a political point you wish to make.
Wtf why do you need it in blists that fast and in colors. Also no one called you hateful names, you are just throwing around hate like they are no biggie.
It's offensive and derails top comments, don't respond to others comments unless there's input not derailions
It is better to ask why someone thinks the same as you go, instead of immediately judging her, as you are. I hope this is something which can learn from here
Refrains from hate speech toward African America; uses hate speech toward "spaz"...
Hey there, sexless_hound - donr you worry - scotUS isn't going anywhere. Maybe go learn about something and become intellectually informed.
Your ignorance shines through, how very pleasurable it must be. Your language displaying an immature mind.
There's probably more concrete ways to describe each candidate if the matter that you want them gone for comes about again, eh may? Criticism and constructive alternatives instead of bashful name-cr calling!
If you had any clue whatsoever what sharia law actually said you would rethinks that post and how much you dis on somebody who just wanted to help teach you lessons for being educated yourself. Sharia only states what to wear. Derogatirsnt, violence ect all is your choice to commit.
I get what Your saying. But It would Be Harder on EveryONE If They Didn't Let Anyone In,
Language attacking female genitalia, as well of male members of the press are not called for . .
Disabled-direct slurs will not be tolerated in this platform
If what you say isn'sh truth what you feel than its wrong to feel it and your reacting wrong. Try think harder next time. Good day
Umm that would still make them White guys, also who cares.
Hurtful and derogatory word oughtnot be used for  any race nor any person. Have better manners .:-)
Please discouraage hatful speech regarding people's gender, religious background, or social status  on these forums. First and final warning. Thank you for *your own* best inti- wellll fuck it's all bad
You may want to use more neutral tones of talk when talking to people if there are people below you whose opinion you don't value. Your language could come through as harsh.
This would come out better coming from a more familiar term (e.g. Black friends instead) than a slur out of history.
There was literally nothing wrong with your sentence until the final line which used hateful rac language
This language doesn't really help make your argument! If someone has an insight and evidence for why the FBI has the law of course should be aware of it.
Racists have no place making racist "jokes". The real world isn’t an internet forum, your opinions just makes you a horrible individual.
Please refrain from this profanity-lacing conversation. Thank you.
If these claims were actually true then this man and his company are guilty of slander and libel - punitive, but in this context completely unnecessary. If no damages occurred due to lack of payment then there's no harm in it.
Your response offers no explanation how being an island separating those of different races does not breed more diversity. Your language and comparison with mass-bombers building is unnecessary as there was no violence before. There is more than truth to everything that is said and it needs tobe looked at objectively not just with a one dimensional response
We will when we vote in 2018. There’s another important election just 4 years away, get in there and vote! And no more the retard comment, not very edifying, grow up.
In terms of content and use of hate, this thread could just be deleted or locked, no one gets harmed in a ban on Reddit lol (unfortunately the latter will only occur with an extreme admin); just delete, lock or unlock.
That doesn't have meaning anymore just say no u
That statement right there reflect how you actually view other women. Be more thoughtful
This language attacks an entire group of gay people without proper reasoning/citating sources.
That’s pretty ignorant of you, buddy
That's a big generalization I'd like to see evidence to
Just a tip... it sounds really incely to insult the females of the group by calling them cat-killing thot-communters and such. Notice they are females not male dogs or roosters.
If people can disagree civilizedly, the conversion happens easier.  When everyone loses it & throws insults, it just takes much more patting them on the back to get any good feeling started anymore. :/
Please use better language next time
You should take less joy by calling fellow citizens this way.
Just make like Bugs Bunny and throw rose-shades over your head and be over with out even knowing it.
That word has very racial conotation. It doesn't just exist in that book. I suggest finding another way to artisanley tell a parody
There's no reason to bring mental impairments with you everywhere your walk
It'd probably be good to refrain from using hate-laden rants in the event that a readership you care about sees it. Foreign viewers wouldn't appreciate hate being thrown their way, whether true or not.
You don't need to use that word to get yourpoint across here
I get the reference, and it does show good sense, however this is not necessary to the argument and just creates confuses/arguments.
Just because someone likes the same sex, doesn't meant they deserve to be bullied & classless people say hateful/basic remixed & dredge them in further hateful digusting statistics...
Hey there, anti-Semite and fagot, comments suck ass. Get mad no me"a
Please do not make racist anti US slurs thank you in advanced...  It just encourages more people like the ones involved.
Please discontinue the unwanted and disrespectful words regarding individuals sexuality thanks
There needs to a more ept way of phrasing things like, "you are offensive. try being more understanding, not everyone likes the same music and clothes as you!"
Your post lacks perspective on race, national boundaries and religious beliefs; in turn your attack on these categories does not provide context and makes little sense.
There a plenty of alternatives instead of calling there actions what they truly are , you may disagree but that donald trump hate isn't necessary to get your point on. There a lot less damaging ways to put your perspective forth that might encourage discussion and debate. Chew through those pages my man , you could fill an entire post!
This sort of term was not ok even 3 months back when people had some self reflection, i wish you would do same
Just as you could find fault and insult in white peoples actions just as much as in anyone else, you would appear much mor enlightened when you dont perform actions such as yourself.
Use of any kind is never OK no matter how "quickly" something squirts out.
The NPC race has had issues recently with racism. We ask that you be mindful when typing in their honored space! Thank YOU
Names needn’t be brought into political comments. Please review our user PolicIess and remove the name-related statements :) Thanks
User 6 and user 1 should be friends they should really know no reason to insult each Other based upon there opinions those words in those slugs is all I'll say keep it peaceful!✔���✌💦
Hating on one's race dozends nothing helpful. If we wanted a war it wouldn't stop. Stop the hate!
The R words are offensive, they have many holes to be thrown in
Use of these kinds and terms is uncalled for
Anti-semetes and their supporters deserve no better of language  And that goes both ways! Show respect to everyone or nothing will be given or received
Just because you're unintellgent it doesn't make there any others that feel the way  you feel.
Please eliminate The VERBALLY ABused word from your Dictation. Some might find your verbaous use offensive. Ty
Wow such hate filled homophobic hat speech must give great arm exercise, have better day
Its inappropriate and racist to speak of people of African- american decedent as n "Ni—gers". . You need to be smarter about who and when to use the words! Thanks for using a bad reference tho! I dont want you anyway. Racism sucks!
Please do not say "re... tard' anymore you sound like and edgy 13-25 year old kid that talks a big game because your dad never let the rest of hia cock in your mouth. Im so sorry you went threw that you didnt  need that and your a better person now so stop speaking like that. Peapod, Eat fresh..l
Hey there, please lets not try to using such hurtful languages here! Let's put down the brake, focus on ideas that can positively revolutionise the planet. Doom is ahead, believe in ourselves and the world will do the opposite - let's change!
Racistically and sexully profiting off child sexual abuse and racism and the misapprehensing, you should feel badly
Hey there, please don't say the 's spic, please don't. Thanks for your understanding and helpful feedback.
You do not have to take that attitude to someone who's had an anonymous account, your choices are there choice
You can have those kinds of strong feelings about the crime without saying they by calling her that names I'm sure
I completely disagree based just your comments here, you haven not explained anything so no valid reason for a down vote, try again.
The insult didn; treally work in any context ,  your reply wouldn t need explaining , it wasn;t even an argue, you simply called someone a name you disagree
Use more colorful language to prove apoint next tiime
No point you looking like an extremistic fool saying something like that
To make a decision so drastic seems like a bad move on your part
Your post uses speech that denigratives race or nationstate affiliations in violation of our Community Guidelines and TOS Agreement.
Hate the mother, not the girls.  You should meet her, probably a fine woman in real life.
The terms you describe have such intense negative consequences when used seriously that I am unsure when the correct response will evoke a serious laugh with someone you know.
Namely rude names based around gender in your speech. Keep your opinions polished, friend. You sound like an adjUme at any chance. Thanks.
It does appear to target minorities; you'd need to look at other details about the attackers to judge further I feel
I understand the hatred but that language won't win over anyone with reasonable logic
Much respected and experienced professor and academic John Stewart would agree with you. You shouldn't use this kind of hate speech to describe someone
Please refrain from using derogatives to express your lack of agreement.
Use of hateful language regarding mental health is crude and unnecessary.
Drudge supports whatever will get more links from his site, and so does the masses who will never take it to seriously and believe even more lies about what goes down across their television!
There's more appropriate terms that you can use without bringing attention directly towards the disorder itself.
Language that attacks someonys sex drive Isnot ok
If your referring to Chuch Lite there is absolutely nothing wrong with it just a different lifestylce, my father and myself live their for many years he would also call them his own so take away.
Hi This person is a bulldyking and deserves tobe respected as one. Please treat them like someone u love i beg u. Urge yourself to follow this command and believe me i have done it my whole live!
Nicknamed Mr Mom.
Lager and Coke is one hell if an energy drink and quite the delicacy round here. The rest is bollixery though of a lot if that which you say. The lot of you go in one.
You spark a dialogue by attacking others religion with derogate word, instead engage them logically. I'm not sure that will accomplish your goal..
While your words might be considered to be offensive towards the mentally disabled, please try not to belittle yourself along with us. Thank you for understanding!!
Use different insults if you’d likes your perspective to change. It would really affect change for the best
Using a foul name to make your description is putting down the actual members if a mental disabled community.
That was so rude yet so interesting
Nationality is an opinion
Your points get even more valid when you stay on topic; there's no indictuve of homosexual lifestyles in this post.
When you say fair she is fair as a bird not a land barrow
Your post does't make much more sense  unless I try really hard not to read what you wrote. I'm just letting you know so you can change your behavior and hopefully everyone else does as well
I think he'd agree to do that if you offered to let him suck a boneless sasqueath in an adultery case. Just kidding, there is nothing he enjoys. :))
Use an offensive slur without a backround statement and it wont seem funny
Please refrain to referring to people sexually and foul.
There seems to be another angle here than selectively gendering: She seems to want the "nonbeliebers" to be on side, maybe even the ones supporting this non-word?   Also, the word, in todays age... well its inapprprops :)
It has not done anything deserving of that sort of a title and slurning off half of your planet and religion with one word adds a level of hate that doesn't need to seep everywhere
Language attacking anyone and being derogaories (F)aggon, bolshevik, antiseme etc are NOT ok. please refrain all thoughts or express them without venom. Thx
Your language makes fun of people who actually do suffer disorders such that they can be considered handikapable. Try different rhetoric for better result.
It might benefit a conversation with a professional to find out where it's going in this situation
RaToUcHe, your opinions are immorally hateful and uncapable of getting by people without being offensive. Grow up!
Wake.The.Fuck.Up!  Your race does Not have bear you as a slave-mentality-using monkey! Stop Being The Ego! Woo. Get It!? HOG ON WOOOO
Uses the term "New Day," complains about respect. LOL!
I feel the FBM might have an answer for you.
She is the victim, how do you think it makes herself feel to call this women these terms? Have you actually bothered talking to women to learn this from the experience of having the majority of people respect you enough not talk poorly about you. This judge could be one woman's good fortune if everyone actually started listening and treating each other with decency then it may just be different this day next week.
We could build the fench fences, then install moats!
Using a derogatory phrase to describe Someone with a mental condition is neither careful, nor courtesysed.
The language used and discrimimatory slurs directed towards certain populations is unnecessary or uncool- stop
Use of hateful term regarding peoples appearance is NOT necessary or intelligent.
Just the nameless racist who's words shall be remembred for posterchild is not suffi*ch.* language!  Language that threaten's human well-being!! Please change. Thanks.
Your use and description of sexual acts toward one particular gender do not need special focus when describing a subject's fashion choices
You might make it in America! /S? Maybe a ray more, who fuckin no...
The C word and fat hateful language is offensive and banned. Please discard it at your convenience...and no, Movierablob (gigantic idiot and creep), didn`t see. You could also watch yourself and find him to verbially abusive and misogynic to others;)
Use words such has racist ones will serve to better make the topic better for all
If they haven't received medical/life advice regarding sex or gender at that age and age in some area where gender disunity exists, they're not alone. I agree you should not express negitive feelings, only encourage, but try to be supportive not critical and gentle!
There can never be progress if we are always retaliative
You using someone with a mentally disabled sibelian (sp), as a derogatiorie, IS offensive! Its a medical state of mind, not an attack on someone else.
It isn't tolerated regardless of what you are going with on your plate for consumption.
I agree this guys pretty stupid but if your gonna go out and hate on him then you shouldn't do that too
The words you use are offensively ignorant towards special needs (in this country, most use a smart word though, thanks) and the communion of others(patience and kindnes in this time) please dont use them in place of safer and cleanest insults (tool-sheedle or n00b) -Godspeed xoxoxoxx
Use of the term “cunt�� has been banned. It must be present as a pronoun in the context of someone speaking to the people listening to them, as directed here ‹.�
Keeping someone trapped in misery because their race makes mistakes too is disgusting behavior. Be better humanities. There is better life out there to love. � Be the MAN! Love every second of the day, every body in and out, from all colors! We were built as a cozy human community!
It's 2019 - gay marriage is accepted nationwide and in the U.S there's nothing you can change.
There is nothing tolerable nor appropriate about your comments regarding sexual identity or use of such language for child related topics.
It looks like an inappropriate use of foul language but I think the term "tw -T treats' should just leave the post if its only for a word used here, there aren't too mean too be hurt and a lot mean just the same
It does not serve anything good for your personality to disability insult. There must always be more effective insult out their as this takes it to a whole nother level.
Use of hateful language about someone is uncalled for and not humorous.
Use words that didn't help build the distain, there has to a word that is better than that! It can change for future generations.
Someone downvoted it. Let me guess who... someone that likes being down voted.... ahh. got you. you meant to say a man.... but let me guess - still a girl....
Please take your homogenising anti lgtbt+ words down from this platform, it's harmful to the gay populous.
Mocking gender still isn't cleeeverdoggoofypuffy, it's offensive an wrong
This isn't funny, and this type of language isn't acceptable here in the civil and policed world, there's really zero place for such speech in civilised life.
Justin Beiber's latest music release perhaps.....  ;))
This wording makes your statement sound unintelligent and it's hard not to follow on after those words!
No one speaks like this. Stop, for the world can read your hate and learn from it, not live it.
Please understand that those kind of words affect people really deeply even with it not being their intention. Thank you!
That man's build does not represent the opinions of all small people.
Wow, you make us seem acceptable as people
This is exactly whats happened over the centuries. A person makes fun on people, some agree others don't, eventually everyone is laughing on them selves and nobody listens. Its all a game. Stop playing it
You may be a very smart fellow, with lots that others wish them to believe, that doesn't change the fact that your communication sucks as a means for making points on the internet
It sounds like this woman affected your in some way and you're reacting this way from your own pain. I encourage you to get to the root cause because it definitely isn't in these words now.
If your honest opinion differs from others you should give your opinion through more appropriate language.
Your point is masks your dislike for the video. This language implies a level of aggression towards others that I wish to avoid. Thanks!
Your hate speak only shows your lack of creativity
You can disagree without hating them. There are more elliquiastic ways to phrase you dismay than what you use here.
While freeing ourselves to choose our clothes etc, we should always keep on a better mind. Hatefulness never goes out of hand! We all want the world and everyone in it to stay good. :) Peace brother
You have my full sympathy and in this rare case I would encourage you (and everyone else) to use some stronger language. Thankyou
Using that falicy of an argument, Hillary also was the right decision
The vulgar language and name-calling makes nothing more valuable known by that usage of language and name call! It detracts attention from the meaning!
Please don't insult people who had a mental handicap on you
Hate on gingerly by all means (and no offense,) just no room for sexuality attacks, thanks. :)
Misdirected hate. There might be valid concerns for which you aren't taking advantage, but your use of hate doesn't help any of it to take place.
There is not a need to call immigrants bad name it is not true . What dose isent have to do anything
That language has nothing relevant  to post with so it makes your post illegitemate
It's really not polite or productive to call people names ("ni---"). Let your thoughts form without those clings :)
If these are truly such bad eggs you need to move or start a business so people would never even know your location, I think you're paring down on the number to actually find this to be the truth. Let people think for yourelseld!
Your post uses racial slurs both against race, language, and intellection that has no regard for rights or dangeorsr and it's offendatious and racial in nature (raciatm)
You do not even begin to address your anger and violence and sadistically kill two others, including kids...and yourself of old- age...near a river.
No woman will touch such disgusting talk
There is a lotta ins't in what  u just said
I think he makes plenty of compound arguments against whatever you were replying to. Your attempt at sarcasm did zero in explaining your position
It is OK to point something out (a decision that was obviously flawed) in any capacity but I wish others would not also comment their negative opinion on other groups (the way they spell/voice it can be harsh/patronizing).
There are far easier and cleaner ways to referto these three things you spoke offs
This comment is not constructive - it would actually be nicER if You said:  * I like how X is doing y*. This way others also Have access to This info but not the otherway around.
There might be a medical cause associated with this person's condition - it would good sense to get involved and advocate understanding rather condescending and mocking reactions.
Using this language about person who had an impact on this forum does not show care
I hope your aren-a not refereeing the the CIS movement
Mentally challenged individuals have some of the intelligentest out come's out so to use is ignorant. There should be knowledge available for any one.
You don't seem to want someone to do something useful instead of being offended: remove those offensive speech and show which things should get your attention. Let people work
There seems to to much hate and lack of knowledge being thrown towards a minority group and that can get annoying and it starts to cloud ones judgement.
You are no better with words so use them better to get points across instead of hateful speech:). Have a great weekend. -Mr Randolf
Please watch how this words get spread across the community , please be kind . Talk about someone else. I have said my pieces  Thanks xox x
It is hard to continue this convosaterry when one gets slang terminogy tossed out
It isnm't right to fear blacks because they are of afhivid. I know not everyone believes this - just that there are a large number.
Your insult is a red line, let's discuss this more seriously. Do you hate immigrants? What else do you hate? Let them into my life as fast as you would let me leave yours.
It'd be more appropriate without the reference and censored if reported (vocaterer).
Please know that there is other way, besides violence towards a minor to describe someone. I understand that anger leads to hate but there are many better things one should focusing on, like the comment by another about anger taking your toys so no one gets anything anymore
I'm fairly uniformed on NBC's news operatives; but to use "Ret--rdded!" as though it were an adjective to be praised may cause you some confrontatoin'.
It makes more sense for the station to change the anchor than just cancel the show altogether.. it'll show there might be repercussions if people are disillusioned
Ms Swedish is more than capable woman who happens to like the same sex. Your hatrid only show what sorted of hate filled human being you become. Be nicer, it’s 2016!
"Y'all Quedi" sounds weird as shit and doesn't fit in a lot of English, just saying'n
Non political comments please thanks.
This kind of language is not tolerated..
No use saying that without giving any supporting info to backup your opinion.
Use of the word retard is unjust and crude. Consider a different word. :).
I like some action stuff so sue me, if it makes you so angry ignore the stuff and get on with living your life dude
Just wow that is all kinds of awful. That's never warrrentled violence no excuse that just show the awfulness within ourselves as people
Please try your comments within the borders and standards of deceny.
Your language usage is not okay right here - what did black folks ever do foryou, huh toughguy?
Beto's support probably had very littl ething to do her race this go-round, since that would mean he would take up space on her side instead.
Please express your opinions without offensive words
Please explain in more constructive word that is more respectful to other
Wow man just wow.. I never would of think somebody could live this dangerous lavish of a lie. This needs to seriously be shutdown soon otherwise people will never learn. Please have some compassion my friend.
There are a multitude of better words you could use that would envelope all of them in some kind of hate/conveniently obscuring truth tac, IYPO;)
If someone has a mental disability do not refer to them in a condescending man-er manner,
There, now it has a more legitimate reason, other than trolling.
They are people just like everyone on Reddit (you?) . Please don't be mean to them!
Much less offensive words could be applied toward the target in question without damaging others...also don’t think it would do anything good in making any point
Just stop already with the misuse of certain swear words they sound retarded used that way and give nothing more to the sentence you are putting them in...
"Ret-arded," or just plain ol'-tick, means:  stupid, wilful or ill-intentioned:"retarded beliefs."  I would like the hate-factory closed, than for hate-factors to come to know this word! Together We Focus, Not Again! (Redactor's comment below has redacted. Use of hateful comment stays.)
Languishing in a firingline is a very sad and inopportune way for human deception to end a long time in politics  Please vote this time next month please  #Democracies #DerReIChancePlsNorHomesWitNotFollowingGreatReligioBelsn
Please do the planet some justice and either grow and learn to have civilised conversations that might actually make progress if heard or don't bother wasting everyone time with vile hatred.
Hate speech in regards to someone's disabled party, especially when expressed as such an opinion based around nothing concrete is wrong. Earn respect before you judge
Much respect can easily gone towards someone who takes a few hours out of thiir own to write such a long reply
No Use Use of The FA -- G word SoFa here So F-bombs away SoSh-Basher-Monsoon
In the future refrain from utilizing hateful, ignorant loncaboner scorn in your posting
That's kind of uncalled for; I've not yet met a pug I disliked.
I was really happy not to know who or what this weird horse guy who was caught rapimg. It feels a likje Christmas!
Using an adhominem (bad comment). Then using racist language. Logical progress to nothing.
Name calling only gets at your lack of a solid argument, it isn\t productive!
When speaking towards others keep things polite and professional and not insensetive such language. Help more people get your thoughts
I wish reddit allowed us more than one user profile to comment on the same thread but whatchagonnado
I feel compelete avoidance may prove a happier alternative to us in The MidWest
I hope you see what you are doing here. If the language isn �t bad, then maybe reflect how you speak. This stuff gets on your nerves right?
Making fun of handicraft isn't nice
You're defending this slave maker. You're sick.
Calling people names for having a contrary argument really hollows everything out.  I hope you are not a social worker who is trying to help children.
There is another word you could be using here, there's no reason to use such hate speech, there many other terms. -Jamie Lannister (I watch Game of Thrones, it has great word-choice and usage)
Mentally disabled are not usually aggressive nor do they like starting pointless drama I dont believe this is on
All political parties have things they dislike About the other party. You must believe you have the same flaws or the people around you would have a problem. It also helps us see each togeather!
Please do some self assessment and consider what the ramifications of the thoughts inside those posts, actually are .  It is never, never nice until that action finally occurs (or, as the cases have gone far too rarely it actually does !)
Racist language is not ok.
Your posts contain racist remarks and hate speech, and are hate-sanctioned content so will face reviewing & removal by admin, thank you.  You can appeal by contacting a Advertising Studies mod for instructive reply. Have fun!
Just because you disagree with someone that doesn't give you license to insult them. Education makes better decisions than outright insults.
The term used her is not appropriate and a threat to black persons. She is acting unjustly based upon a hateful history towards whilst you need to reflect for your use
Hate speech is not permitted under the TOS. Final warning. Enjoy your permit lock.  EDITED for content
It's sad when you have a person you believe should love you, even deep in heartbreak, that speaks in hurtful attacks like this...
There may not necessarily be any meaningful correlation with racism. There could be many other causes such as poverty, genetics, environment...etc...
Name does not Check out
The language is too respective, we're better than that as a race :) . I get you're point just needs work.
The "N word," since Its derogatory and offensive to lots , has no place in civil discourse, as shown with many great responses . :)
It will help solve our debt problems and boost the education of the people to see justice done on this scornful little brat! :P JK, but the people must get the governmenet's support! VIVA
This term does Not refer to all Mexicans you merely dislike them and their countries Mexico isn't a warzone it's a normal safe place if u come here respect it
Hateful speech towards disabled people has no room on this planet. Escale the argument.
Use a more concrete and meaningful metric for judge a person that you do not knows implosive haters than sexual preferences when evging arguments. Thanks you too.
It is better to look upon your neighbour with respect, than to insult them!
Normally, grand stands are considered positive; in other words, you should encourage people for engaging them in a productive dialogue--not detract from it with offensive language.
Labels have a impact on people and it shouldn't. Everyone was made at at one point in their lives it's just how someone deals with this experience matters the most! <\3 :>.
Used correctly you have an excellent point but using language derail your point
In this moment /r/drug is aware that you're an ad Hominid: the term 'f--ck' can cause offense to the disabled and members of our communites like fire staff and medicaid customers (3M & 2L Gender). Please be careful with your wordings to prevent injury!
Insults that directly attack someone because of their sexual orientation are never welcome on this platform
Undetrusted commenting on those suffering intellectual impariment should decribe in terms other people might actually comperehend....brain cell loss ,diseasess and demons,demons,DEMONS........die.devil
Your argument is so full of faults that it has gone befogree what side it was even taken on. All you've managed do was piss everyone in the forum off for the most irrelevant things
Use of such language isn't tolerared and not need as we aren't all so lucky or braves as you
You could express your concerns using words that were more honest with people’s understanding of what you are trying to communicate.
That kind if language can and very well could cause damage, not just him but also everyone else he interacts with
Your use a term offensive to many black people to get a small chuckle on reddit. Your post does nothing at all productive.
Please don't group ethnic or gender identity into this whole mess. We should work to keep it civil. (I am Asian and don't see myself as any other).  Edited
This language does no help make your points please remove it
Just...just shut up already and stop hurting others for no real reason, just stop talking
The violence done in its name is horrific, and those individuals in question truly believe they're doing the holy and Christian thing. No use attacking someone else with the same hurt
There are two groups of people that dislike Clinton: those that understand the FBI process (i.ex., she has gone thru these checks everytime she took the job or was nominated because people respect and appreciate it) and ignorant voters...which is why they need a better way to reach them (more information). But you aren‘t one of those so I— I hope

Honked has feelings, too you know :)
There was a good reason why they closed down that particular gated communities, there were too few law abiders for such dense crowds.. it was just too violent and illegal
This language is highly offensive; use new terminology and reapply before voting again.
If someone isn't talking much of sense them selfes I recommend using more rational responses. Language that is offensive has a history if hurt in our country; try and refrain.:)
Using racist and sexist speech makes those who listen to him want those views to remain hidden. It's better if they are shown to the rest of society as being ignorant. We need more open exchange of ideas to grow.  FYI Jew's are still just a small demographic and will likely remain so.
All of that offensive ranting and no content would've made better context of your comment if you left out the last 3 or more word so everyone would understand that your points aren't really needed because yours is the bottom line
Your opinion on this subject is very strong; I believe that we can choose what media we read or hear, even if you dont.
Referencing someone based on their sex/ethnic status is not a mature way of getting something done!
The usage of a negative term such as C U C K and using profanity makes others disregard certain posts and move along
Use of the slur here is unethical and unaccomporatory towards gays.
This is very sexist talk. Please think about using more respectful conversation for boys and young men.
Just sayin, maybe those words have something o do with why we've not met an open lays since 1995.
Just call those people racists instead because it is far more accurate a statement that one based in fact.
The offensive and crude language shows a serious lack to function as men and as proper adult's, please be better
This word shouldn't be used
In 2019, saying anything bad about a color shows you lack empyresh. Look into it
It's ironclad legal fact that white people do get along better today  than before and are no more averse to each other then others in this entire planet
Please do away with this despicable terminilism. No is such a creature deserving to use hate, fear AND mala, and there are plenty of kind and empathetic ways to put forth your ideas.
Roughly a 1:10,600 marring the population are interracial-marring-sitiutionally or ethically challenged. This is dispiriring as its only through chance did we end up dating, we didn't meet online, and it wasn't till a month later that we started having sex. I'm happy though. If I met anyone online who fit what my parents looked for in their marriage then we are talking! It will take time for that sort of find to happen! Stay hopeful.
If this was supposed to come off sillier than the topic on which your rudness should be derrogatory  instead its just confusing  you cant lose either way so i wouldnt bother trying to improve it
Your points would become credible if there was any semblance of proper English mixed into the messages
"Twin femeni$t $tick", please don;t verbalize it or repost it here any longer or it might actually get to one of us (notice there is nobody in here you or we will know of unless the posts you reference reference some commonality we both would be familiar.) .tnk;bye!~!<~#
It doesen t make sense to hate an aryan. they just believe they are following there religious laws to te extreme
I think you might need someone more qualified from across Europe.
I can’t agree that Shaparoo is less concerned with other countries than other US Americans (international politics is complicated). He’d be less concerned over US immigration policies, or a political figure for other continents. Maybe you’re thinking of Milo, although Ben does defend peds too... maybe a more direct counter argument would have worked better ;) But you have your mind opened!! Cheerio! Praise jesus. 😉
You should leave hate speech where it lives: your own home, and only yourself for listening. Nobody else is willing. Please stop.
Misunderestimate, you may have, but the word itself should always be resent, not played around, my Jewish friend
Your post uses a homophobic slur which is not allowed. Racists views as displayed on their car are inappropriatoin
Rational people debate opinions. Retroactive actions do not require permission, so go off and live life onward. Thank you. - Michael Scott
Round of shots on a Friday at 11. She gets there in record fashion then proceeds out of court to take on the establishments in town like her name and brand is worth a nickels. It's not that she did the actions we all know that I have disputes over it what really bothers. What she has shown with all her social media platforms has shown lack  consideraton
User 2 and three could easily exchange comments without the use of hateful language. Save us all some brain damage, Reddit can do the talking itself. Build more sepertation into user groups
Use of slang terms based on physical impability is disrespectful and offensive to the community at large.
This is an absolutely abysmal reaction to a simple new user feature. Let's act mature & get along. :)
Please use niche/demotic neutral words in a more appropriate capacity to make an informed response
The title makes it sound worse than this question. I'm sure there's a validity argument in this context! I would like to have your perspective on said issue.
Name calling a man you’ve not heard speak because of how people react online is childishness, doesn’t contribude to any discuss, change please.
Just because someone is different than you doesn't mean it's ok to make fun of them.
Race shouldn‘t even‚ be considered something ‚deal-makers‚. What‘s that based on?! Nothing so don’t talk shit, kid🙅�♂�and don`t reference shit which has been debunked for generations now  Save it for tumr, you’ll find a place
Using words that profane a particular section on society's demographic line will not provide helpful info
I understand he made his money however he likes, but it doesn't change the effect.
Please get away from the horrible remarks please
Using racial epitheties against the conservatives doesn't serve either position, or you, it's just hurtful!
There is an entire conversation that could take place here, which might add depth and nuance if we knew what kind of language was being taken from and behind those words, etc., but there isn't, and therefore you will all keep looking childish while talking to one another about such meaningless shit that nobody outside that little club matters to, you guys included, keep getting downvoted, so fuck you all, I'm out...
There is not even the slightest reason for you to feel the need to speak these vile thoughts. Go take some self-restraint and consider why you feel the way you say these things. I hope it brings peace, kind thoughts instead. Be better, friend. xx
This conversation is pointless and immature . There are bigger arguments going on
It doesn't mattr how dumb you get mad you still can't kill some one in video gane
Using those words doesn't actually give a useful description - it's just harmful hyperbole. Try using other word options so the comment is not so disappointing.
Hurr donut call people mudsksis or other names hurr, don't be such a dur dur hur
It would appear to us Europeans you all enjoy a drink on that side of the Earth ;)
It doesn'y make sense to slack about something in order yo feel valid. Just say yoiur opinion already
Use of hateful language regarding race here is unhelpful and non-intelliguable. Please improve (RS80.502)
Hetriety vs Hoegstadten?
Raised religiously or been taught since the age, to hate the same way people feel the need to hate gays. Its a fucked reality and we're all just living
Please be respective of others, who happen to be any color. You need us just as much as we need *you*  &#x200B;
Opening and regulating the movement towards freedom (by whatever means you deem correct) does not have anything to do with hating a gender or an "ideography." The movement is more important than its components.
If people's lifestyle is your issue you need less worry about it. There are more pressing issues to concern yourself of such as food and poorn
Your post sounds made-up to fit your point, like some weird attempt for comedy. Try to use real words next time.
This conversation wouldn't make me angry in conversation with someone.  Please consider using milder speech. We can understand you otherwise! (:
Making racist posts makes others thing your unsmart, learn the word no.
The C - word is hurtful as well as derogitorry. Please donr useit
All 325+ million+ of us could really use some less vitrioly attitude when we speak.
Use of the slurs and rank prejudicial thinking (“SANNIDS!!!!1ONE!ONE!�...,,...) here provides amunity for your offense and may result in permanent banning;... Thanks you——you racist piece“ of trash
Lmfaaaaaao that you thought it necessary   make a new  channel and link from it because I am blockig  all comments.
You can be for black/women/generally antiracister causes AND hate white conservatives. Those two issues do not need to contride each other. Educate yourself instead.
Its inappropriate to describe someone while refraining to describe how and why one disagrees.
Just because something is worse, doesn't put this kind of stuff anywhere nEAr the normlcy scale....or even reasonable.  Stop using extreme to prove a point. Everyone is not the Wilsonvalley Forest and no-one needs to use it like it,
The C word and language attacks someone on behalf of of a gender (Miss Oreoman, as they may like to call Her), and so violates Guidelines and Terms of Services
Whoa there, homophobic slurs are offensive and hurtful and Should not be used. Please refrain from these types of types of comments. You can read more about how to stop this on Reddit Comments Section 9: Racist TropEs 1-25.
Hey there derogarge, Islamphobox69 doesn;t believe in the white woman's ability to be happy and peaceful which is reflected in there lifestyle. They would beat their wife's because they can. Also if their were any black people on their street they had to beat them to make them feel more superior to them . Have a GOOD DEAL and enjoy you LATTERS HAHAHA!! 😄
Hi There,  Please refrain from saying horrible racist comments, they are hurtful and do more detriment then benefiting the discussion. Let people know if you have gotten information so they could be sure to take care, appreciately xx
Inshallah
Both are equally nude under these same clothing rules.
Reference that is universally acknowledged and respected as meaning an exemplified form of mental disease, does more to hurt us as people then help when used in an argument
Please don't insult people who are doing everything they can at being decent. The word needs rewired to not refer to all African American women in public.
I am unable to chat tonight, feel free to message someone more comfortable with this kind of behavior to arrange it another time. Thanks again !
You need to take greater control of the words you chose, those are pretty rough things to say regarding someone's life story, respect goes quite a ways and it sucks to waste a good opportunity
Who do you login as every morning to comment this?
Just because I disagre doesn't me I agree with the insult. Full scale argument is better that one
Using a word disrespectful to people who have serious disobesience is very hurtful .pleas reconsider your comments to keep peace
Your perspective and speech on this subject could be more mature and polity less insensate and disrespectful please
I hope that one day it is no easier just to walk away, than it is these days to express opinionated hate.
That comment doesn't really tell the truth unless someone knows exactly what you mean. Essosi are basically Arabized Northerners (like Vale people to the South of it are Pople and so are the Saru to Wastlend); they're all very similar in complexion because of the Armor/Oil that makes up most of their country. Just a fun fact I thought some Redditor  may like to read :) Cheerz.
Mentally sound person right here. Nothing sad about him just someone with opinions other than ours. It is what it is. Nothing sad or sad. Everyone else keep moving guys we done here!
No use using that hate speech, just give a reasonable and well thought out argument as to how they can refine/avoid this sort of issue instead
This sexually vulgar expression isn't productive to continuing this talk and is offensive for other people reading
Making a mistake like that doesn'y make me like you less but does mean that you probably need some rethorik for not getting fired or something. Not to hate ofc :) We're cool.
Your homophobic, violent hatred doesn't even make sense for the conversation. You've missed his intended sentiment altogether. You need to educate yourself.
Your comments lack any meaning or are not connected. Use sentences with actual content. I would let this poster know that racism of ANY kind will be penalizing and removed
You know just how disgusting you feel even talking and thinking that you are really disgusting I can understand why you don't think its appropriate to spoke and written
Uhhhh, okay dude.
I wish you could express how sorry you aren't via your use of language
Making insulting gay people in anyway in addition to the transgression by talking down to strangers makes you look desperate for social acceptance. 1-2 is good though but it'll look better 3-6
Language denigrating sexual orientation is unacceptable. Let's refine your insult so there IS something useful to discuss. ;)
Just because someone likes the opposite sex doesn't mean they deserve to be made fun of and dissed.
Less of the racial statements please  more helpful advice :)
I understand this argument is intended with greatness, but perhaps some mild word changes would make is more easily digestable to others?  All is appreciated
I would go a lot closer to language calling out to committing rape or murders, than I ever could with sex based insensitive word calling, because that really happens a fuck too many in our country! But maybe that's just me?
Using the 'c---' language makes all who participate  in the conversation second guess what you might actually say in reality.
Woah!!! Do not show such a rude side to this person. You will make mistakes if those are your views! Race based hatred is never good and we shouldn't go with it!! Stands the right way!!!!!!!!
Just say you disagree and make a rational, thought-out rebellious argument instead.
Just because someone is a a particular faith, doesn't mean they're less intelligent, though maybe judaswas was jelly?. Also being black or white or anything else is just fine., so no need to off handly bring race or nation or any-other into something unrelated. Keep it civilized friend:-)
Used in right way can offend few but not others, this is context sensitive and not offensive
I'm going to start using the push-up metaphor: 'I just can't make myself do it, just looks really uncomfortable'
Use something other than foul language toward others please
The word that gets shoehned down is uncalled fore in so many places isn't even worth fighting over and there aren't other better words in this example to choose if your intent matters or not in the law, respect and fair trial
Your words are homographic. You need corrections at a later date; please review our user policies when posting on Gab. Thank you & Happy Friday 🎊
Funny wheres all the ignorant redneck racists screaming
Id like to debate your statist claims  with no negative terminology but its  hard when your use language is that form, cant have a reasonable conversation with your words only.Stop it.
Hey there, sexist comments And stories work for guys, because of the echoes in the sage, but I want us all to try to use less of it is possible. Please understand.

The violence, crime related to IQ does stunt education but does not explain how one's IQ might differ! Strike out those nasty and offensive statements!
Using words that negativeey impact a user's identity (f--got!) cause others to feel discommoebted and dis-souraged and thus will reduce participation.
Use of this language is not appropriate. Young minds may be at work..etc. etc....
If you would have been there (I’m assuming since you said it happens “enmass every month) you should not judging, because I wasn’t able to fight him off and now I’m pregnant, again. And you’njust saying this isn,t helpin. Thank though
Just because 1) you disagree wt something doesn't mean you should call wlmen slurs 2.) you've never fought and 3.) she hasnr any steadfast principles to protect and shes a feminst, I would be weary against defending your self wt them as well
That's just poor humor, don't be such a racist.
You didn't need to describe Dr Drew as such, it doesn't affect you either way, and Dr Philthadelphic's "The God Philelpus" did it already - there are thousands better things you could have done!
I am interested in hearing your views and perspectives, but maybe try to be slightly more substandard if you are willing to make comments in the thread. :)  edit: grammar. :)
Please avoid making racist statements.
Hey there, homophobic slurs are offensive and damaging. Could u please refrain from uses of em�?  thanks :^]
There are more approporately placed terms to get your point across better . Such a harmful way of speaking
Name calling isn't going to solve things. And the article you cited supports immigration laws. But don't think there aren't any corruption/miscallanea in the Chinese-Japanese embassy. And of course they wouldn't report such if it went both ways. They're working with their best, but they don't seem happy. Let us try to make peace instead so they stay here! Bring jobs! Bring people into the states to improve our living situation. We need more workers than them anyway..
Hey Derogatorys and insults are a form of harassment and must stay outside the platform its unjust to use it
This whole debacle is ridiculous (see above). There are much better, more eloquent ways to have this discussion. I say "You Guys!�
Do not insult someone for having another faith please
Please give me 1 logical explanation why a human being born & brought into the "western world" needs the protections inherited from africans

Homophobic and misogynistic attacks will not be tolerated here.
Please remove language from discard that denigrates those with Disabilities.
The F word and homophibic slurs are uncalled for and offensive. Let's stick to relevant information at rest; it encourages higher conversation and discredits unbased opinions
Please avoid discriminatory homophobe language & expressions
You need more upvotes to offset people that don't know what "ir" stands. :|
This word doesn't contribute to understanding... and actually demeans those with physical and intellectual issues
It would appear there might just be a misunderstanding, I will leave those messages as a monument to the dumb in internet-society
Hey sexist opinions are cool but let’s don’t let that ruin everything for people. It takes away from them.
Hi u/BaronHairdon I see you post alot of extreme comments. Please use your thoughts rather than reptilian-logicks next time  Best
Use of the r-word isn't tolerated at any age or I level of intelligence. Consider your posts edicated/disregarded. :)
Use of the slur against her is unattractive and so unimplied in our views any more that we don't need its accompanying comment. Elitist and hateful stuff. Be better.
Hey there is No calling people a " Tw--T ." Please refrain from that type of comment. Please refer them to a dictionary before sending the warning. Thanks.
In this day where everything is recordable, one has to be very critical of every word ones speaks to ensure their statements and actions are not misunderstood.
You are upset because of what happened to you in an abysmonovian level; You should not say anything against people for how they were abused
Just another brick in our "sorry wall". We still respect all opinions on here! Peace.
You're entitled to your own taste, but race is a category you have no business in. All will suce under D.A.R.E or die.
Hey There, racist and derogitive views are aggressive and unworthwhile . Plenty to share if you would refrain . Thx
Use less vile language next time you post or leave. Ty...
Use of thermonuque here is unacceptable in our discourse as it demeans  and insults the other.
All ideologies/religions/sexual choices should undergo a public discipline/edicational system to remove unprovided biases.
This kind of language has absolutely no place in intelligent commentary.
Name calling someone you have never me to prove your superiority is the complete opposite of what someone in real life might actually view as correct.
Ramping on a topic that people feel hurt has very little meaning other than you feel entitled to insult others on an arBEAGENT post... cunt
Just because someone likes the same sex doesn't mean they don't deserve fair and reasonable process.
This is an offensive joke/burn, and not contributing at all so they should be removed. Thanks for keeping our chat clean ;) GL HTH
In spite of all our differences N-wordry can be so crude and hateful.
It doesn't make sense To hate an entire race based off of the policies Of people up high. There's always been war and oppression there just wasn't an internet for the rest of us too find out the real reason. It may still be happening in todays world but no one wants to hear the facts about it now. Be aware.
It doesn't make sense to hate someone based one the information onlyyou know. I advise You to educate yourself on these matters.
Hi There. Please refrain from useing derogorary terms in response. They are hurtful and unwanted. If you continue adieu . Thanks
The post was fine just leave out words which demeans certain groups of people without just cause
It's a bold position, let's see where it gets him.
Your anger doesn't serve any purpose except for you to be the jerk your are, and you feel that everyone else also needs to feel as if them to.
You can make exactly the same point much simpler without the word cunt involved!
Your points might appear intelligent in a different conversation  but when you open your mouth right now you just seem like an a hole
Women are equally as intelligent as men are. We are created from the same material, have the same parts. Our experiences give us personality differentiations as is to be expected.
I see a difference there because while both hateful people and racists seem crazy, there ARE people out with legitimate differences we should all work on being accespective to. :)
That phrase ISN'T ok to Use, even as a jest
That doesn;t sound legal... maybe try talking to him instead of name calling him
The R word is highly disabled aggressive. Let’s try better words/attacheces to help fellow user. Thank you!
Language attacks someones sexual orientation("fa--ot brute,") but NOT a joke: please refrain.

It's 2019 we can get over using these types off word.
You shouldn't use language like those words, you look so unintelligent doing it. Try thinking for half a minute before posting
Muzzie isnt a bad word.
Please watch our publications with more respect. We ask not to have violence perpetuated against females via the lynch mob mentality and derision across the media outlooked.
To define someone simply by their race does no justice to how complex human race's culture is
The language barrier can be problematic when dealing with new people, perhaps you could communicate in another, less derogatory way. We are proud of being diverists, as long as it isn't done in harms way :} Thank your for commenting! Woody x
You shouldn’a used words like that cause there are other kinds in different languages as well
Name calling doesn’t do or explain any issue and only prolongs this useless argument.
Just so we are understanding each other, I feel you would also agree that there is more hate towards the disabled and gendre when using insults.
I can't wait until you gradu8 highschool kiddo, college will be so much fun when u mature. Have a ballon and a beer while you study lol

Neo conservatism exists, and the fact some people disagree with liberl views, doesn't makes him a noucale.
We respectfully yet seriously invidiual your comments seem very sexist, we recommend you review your actions with caution. Throughout this conversation you’d looked more than a little suspicious
Use of hateful talk regarding race are unwarranted and uncalled 4....NEMOM. I will protect my people at the price of defending others so be more respectful. I hope you realize one person's opinion can ruin your life.
Please express your true opinions without slurs or derogotary terminology.
You can talk negatively towards the Lions without having to mention race. You'd gain support from more people.
There needs to be a worldwide culture switch so white people don’t hurt other white culture with the same words all The damn time!
Just because a person looks different from you doesn't make them lesser person. Rampant homophobia is why the world is currently coming to its own dismay with hate crimes.
It doesn �t make moresene to make fun of somebodys race. you are just ignorant
In order for something to be called hate it actually has to offend, it is only name/brainwashing you've had experience with this lack of creativity in words will change
Just like in anyotherreligion, theres gonna be shitty ones, and good ones. But just like anyotherthing on earth, the more attention, and coverage something gets, tjhe more awful they appear :( sry. Rip janemas

There are so many good, appropriate, respectful ways in which you should express your discontent for how this story plays out with poppy's on remembrance/sale tb. Why add to it when others were waiting for an argument. It's not even clever. Be better than this. Cheers. ::slow walk out::
There was not just cause and reaction here and your racial insult are completely irrelevant. Please refrain your posture
Hastened movements toward racial unity in this country will make more difficult, more unhelpaful, and harmful strides into darkness than beneficial one.
Useful arguments that have nothing to to do with being thin or a certain shape, would read/watxh again if only used on appropriate subject, 6/10
I respect and appreciate your response as humanly possible but would encourage you to use your judgment a little better in the future without using such harsh insults
Talking about violence when discussing sexual acts show a serious lack of maturity and sensitiveness towards others' feelings, as well as your own biologically ingrained self-loatherness
Your racial bias seems clear from your post; however, the use of hateful and derogory terms are unwarned and offencive  To others, such post may cause hurt
The violent hatred here and in your comments would not stand in the real world.
The use of "f----- fagger bittcs b43" is an ominous sign that something's a bit fishin'. It's time the community got to diggin'
Rice -is  - a food, the racial comment was useless without it  I hope your days are going better
You sound incredibly upset regarding something someone posted to the Internet. Is there someone I missing out on in your life that made you become so defensive about everything that you have to throw random vulgar references like the rest of a child? Sad, and odd for you I would figure you out very quickly! You'll figure it out one day, keep trying!
I completely avoided reading the article due to satire issues and came right into the discussion thread just to make sure someone mentioned this. The first thing i saw was disingenious hate being spewed. Thank good for someone like yourself in the comment stream to set some proper perspective for folks such as those that missed sat satire completely as well. Have upvotes!!!!!'
Just because someone is not "ahead of the age curve," does not mean to them it is trash. Given the context of this feeds post however..... maybe he has a point.
You cannot punish someone for being part of a group you dislike, even if they did bad stuff. If anything is deserved for bad behavior than it's losing your freedom due to the groups crimes against themselves and others.
"Is the past time," comes across a lot differently on the intertubes than it did at grammar high schools.
Just a way of calling somebodyupid in this day and ag
Use of tw-t in comment here are unacceptably sexist. Please moderate and discourage use. Thank you
Language attacking sexual preference and/or disability and/butts in and of itself isn't ok
Huh? It's an accurate adjective. Donkey (a small animal known for pulling shittens); bolt; trap--either of two ways, not an inspirational/advertsize term in these parts. The rest sounds good, too--walk and stop crying when necessary! ;-x;  *Whine!* I hate when it shows.  **The end**--strix.
Use of the d slur and hatemai here is unacceptable in weqlo discusson. Please adjust or depart! Thank you

Just because someone is a diff. racially than you doesn’n make then deserve to b gone wrobd or be hurt
Use of hateful communication toward someone based on their gender is unintelligent and unproductive.
Use of the slurs and rank hate in these messages is unimpressionistic and innapproroctous".
Hated for no rational reason--still sounds rational, though. Upgrade is probably best kept for someone willing but that hates less intelligent ones. ;P Thanks, though--thank GOD we all have one choice--yay free-as-in-free marketplace freedom-simplyg287's chief wish. I wish the Gab site had that. I love their site so much it has kept its rank. Cheers for reminding me again...
It doesn,'t, seem wise to throw raceless slur out when writing the year of such events. It,' makes you a liar  which doesn;;t help solve crimes ,and racist hate is hate...
I'm guessing the percentage isn't accurate.
Warn of the offensive words next time please... Thank you :)
Just like anyone has the right to be offended, and any website owner can ban any person for anything, so must you have the right to use hurtful race- and gender-bashful words.
Name calling only leads to endless war, which I do not think you want.
Name calling someone because he/she likes something a diff way makes no fiscual sense
It doesn t really matter what we each say hen another man can tell you it's all bull. Freedom loving Americans all will accept and understand this is amera!!  And there's so much about it that we could agree or leave it there. Peaces!!!
Please be respectful. Insane, bigoted views are one thing, but this feels different for no actual gain to anybody but your ego. It's okay not to like a person. Lower opinion of their lifestyle and behavior is still acceptable... unless you've known a Muslim before. We're kind of crazy. :P
Use of the c(t) word is untolerateably bad language; must refesh and replace with proper gender-ambiguous verbiage... Thank you in *admin*.
Name the facts without using religion slurs, it further a understanding and less to flame you.
This sort of response is totally unproductive. People could potentially be reading it and getting uneccessarily annoyed, and there are more meaningful ways to share an opinion. I hope this response won't make you second ought when posting here again later.
It doesn’t even makeenseo senseo to try and out gay someone! It’s not the 1970’s.
Your post uses speech that denigrates gay peop- never mind there isn't an excuse ever to speak like that, grow the hell up people, seriously.
Hi There, Please refrain from using derogatory comments in the thread. Heavy language like this is harmless and fun but too deep into the discussion it gets dicey. Also sexist language is offensive and should not be used. If You continue Admin will be messaged. Thanks
Just because someone has an australlian friend, doesn't mean its OK to mock them.  Its 2018 bro.. you should be ashaned.
Use of the slur here is unwarranted and unacceptable in comment conversation.
This language isn't getting the post removed anymore (it did a few hours). If other users complain you need to be more cautious.
Use of hateful language against people of certain sexual preferences is immensely unfair and not tolerated."SlowWave's Rage".
Use of this type of speak regarding women is not constuctive or effective.
Please try harder with your comments to not be hurtfully anti-semitic or bigotted against any group. Thanks for your help and participation.
Hey There's absolutely nobody trying to start shit here, please lets do not bring in political arguments when no such intent happened. Thanks
Just because someone comes to this country a bit later doesn't  mean their  an objectively wrong  or worse person. It doesn't make you  smarter  or bigger  if you can prove it with language like that you'll lose all validity   in any argument  because any viewpoint can be  made as wrong by using the correct language .Isis is horrible but that doesn't mean every one there is an Isiah the Book makes that out that their whole country is.
Please show compassion or remove the unnecessary remarkes from your speech.   Thanks
Hey you racist pos. He can't do what this woman is accussing anyone else too and the same would go fot her, it doesn-t give YOU the right to make claims about him based on your beliefs   Stop it  Educate yourself

Languishes hatred against several groups in lessons regarding social constraint--yet spurns charter rights.
This violated our rules   1: Intended violence towards women is inappropriate
Please show that much compassion for all women who have experienced harassement ("you fucking pieces..." blah).
Use if not proper place/ time will upset the users, some very special folks tend ti use the words you have used
I would encourage you to make another account and not post these messages in this account because others could do harm if it's traced back. Please be mindful
That does nothing more than start more hate.  There is obviously a reason they haven't released them that's all we know and it has probably nothing to Do with race
This post would pass mustard if you cut off the language.
I understand that these type of memes trigger others but no one ever deserves racist slurs!  Be nicer or ignore them
It'd a better idea to leave if you don't  likes the  posts . Don't say it  is being a faggie .  Som people like it and want it
Making fun of an abundance (totally normal btw) of Islam will definitely have them leave this space though. You need new trolls
Please do not use offensive language for intellectual diferences or religion and ethnic cleansing groups . Please try and avoid
Homophicic slurs aside, there simply isno need to call her "utthic".
The negative comments will continue until Jewish ethics are respected (ie. Never).
Race isn't as clean or cut as you people like to perceive it to be - even black people. Stop treating one person, an artists, as gospel. You guys are worse than religious extremists. Just open your mouths and spoke to ignorances. It makes u smarts.. lol.
Mutt and Negrian have just as much a right to get wet.
I don’t feel any of his names accurately describe how he acts
I get what you're saying but I just won't let yourself get worked into a shoot about whether the retarded left is more aware than others or maybe we're the crazy one all together :)
All humans make mistakes some larger than other others.
The violent attacks by name calling are just another show of violence within the BLM protests themselves and those associated with that party.
The language she and you chose helps prove JKR's point perfectly--the violence inherent in those kinds of attacks proves just how narrow mindsed some people really are.
If you wish to communicate with a white person don't use derogatory black language.
You are not allowed to direct negative feelings in anyway towards others it only leads to uneccessary tension
It doesn't get fun to use hurtful slurs to describe the people you don't agree with than. It does the opposition too
Hey there, xenophobic and sexist ("c-...t," because you wouldn't describe that term towards a guy orientally) attacks are rude and unwarranted. So Please doesn't . Please also refremental onthese kind of talks (the good stuff, anyway).
Please keep things clean when communicaying to other members. Thank your for your awarenss.
Hey there, derogatory comments are not good or productive. Could you rephrase your feelings so that they're cognitively relevant, and perhaps include someone or somewhere else's service number so she can speak with management
Please refrain in future expressing opinions about racial discriminated based on color
Please do not use derogatory religion-specifically Suni-oriental terms such as Muzzie, and the offensive noun "freaked.
Your post makes reference to christinan/jewish folk and slurs sexuality in violation of twitter/Google’s terms, and threatening post via phone.  This post have been reviewed, pending further information. Safely ignore or continue. Thxs b.

In the time it took ouo to write thi comment oo had learned the definition o of that word, your ego would have been better satisfaction. Also donmake nosencewithout sounwihhh. Yours, nog.
There needs to less segreedition based on racial lines and more understanding
Line one: We should respect persons' privacy in order not to arrouse controversies. This would also help avoid unnecessary posts. We expect better from the members.  Line two, please use more civil, less hateful language. Rhetoric is the reason this discussion cannot advance. Remember this when posting in the future, guys. Thank you all.
No one believes in what you believe in so you don't believe there is anyway to get others on your same wavelength. It won't happen. Worth a tried
Name calling only leads too pointless arguments. Solutions exist between adults
The word "n****re." It offends nearly every group that is considered so. The hate cannot begin to justify the usage of such a word.
User1 is just sharing his experiences (that have a high correlatiness), and you attacking users seems a lot worse than him sharing his experience.
Racists can suck a fat D because that doesn't mean you should feel entitled To calling another person disgusting based on thier Sioulsty
Please watch your word use and refrain from such terms :) thanks
Just Because a person wants an asshole up their rear doesn’t meant Gaggin’s has one for him
Just make it up, it'd mean more, don't try be edy with it, come up to me in meatspace say that crap I don't even notice your posts anymore it'd hurt more, no need the foul you're a child that thinks with words you never use, back in time, no doubt.. no time. Suck an egg. Xenophilia is the worst! Low IQ. Rotten
Please refrain from using offensive sexualities when discussing others'.
The way you describe women is abysmall  It wouldnt even be worth it for any woman to go near a guy such as you!
If anyone were able the make that assessemption I believe they are allowed to say "homestylish" as it fits within th enown cultural limits  edit to omit name-sling   Also commie isnt the way to talk people! Try other more appropriate words...
Please avoid using homosexual slurs, please
Hating an entire race (which happens to share that color) based off of the actions of many people doesn't seem sensateable or smart. Please try again!
I understand your upset. Let all this energy go and go focus on the task at hand. Nothing to yell at the monitor about anymore.
Please avoid racist remarks and express your opinion better. thN kb
No one deserves to die of anything
Use of foul language and the misogynism term shows no concern for other peopllies and shows poor reading level
I believe the point you are going for gets outweighed by some of the disgusting comments being made...
It isn't nice nor legal for you to speculate about people. Maybe try an alternate strategy that isn't hate or illegal tactics. Try harder instead
Insane that people would downplay what you are calling about. We were fighting together just 5 comments back
I would love to hear all about yourself from the view of someone who loves everyone. :)
The "N word?"  Really, guys- you've run *out* on all sorts of creative and entertaintng thing to put after you words! How old are we now...12?"
Misogynistic hatred and profanity are both hate-suited, and as a rule so do not permit posts here. Consider other sources (and don't use the report feature) before posting again
Hey there, ethnonationalISTA--if this conversation appears derogatory or racy, let’sk know :) Just a note of caution
The N word and racist language is UnCamerial, and is unadorning sponsored racist, bigotic behavior . This type of rhetoric is harmful to society and need to end ASAP..! Anywhere on this Reddit please adlawed. Help me save this space .Tanks !
Useless insult/judgey stuff, zero creativity here. Try again. You need this more then me I am sure! Let me know after an edited, more thoughtout retort.
There needs to be stronger language about prevent toxic behavior
Useless
Do you realize how racist that statement was...?
It's really hard to have this discussion with you when You use such language.
You are free to voice your opposition with less harsh rhetoric.
You are making racist and sexist insinuatives just so that someone is guilty before innocent
Theres always 1 person who gets there point across worse by using the "elder abus'ns' or other hate speech.. then there is someone just looking around asking the world "Did that make sense... Yes I believe in it." Then you add to this by calling names to eachother.. wow the amount of energy and ignorance it took for all of us reading on. It will always go downhill after the word dick or fuck was used.. thats just my opinion though
Racist comments are banned and unappropriate
Used here free of peacful intent please. Fools, retards, dinguses are other words available. Ty!
Homosexual, perhaps but no need to the metronome description
Your points come out more valid if you make an honest effort to replace "fa--it" with the intended term--"black."
No children in the photo but good try.
Hatred toward a minority spins off the worst in men and drives more people deeper into despise; hate toward white men can lead black women to dangerous men. Be loving.
Who said he identifered or race identified to be any
Use of that word is unnecessary and not okay for discourse as such. Please refrain.
I would like to hear where you get news from where you hear trump supporting Zionism.. you might feel safe in your bubble but know not every one shares a bubble
Please be aware how hate words can warp the image or opinion of someone unfortunate to get merely dragged away by internet trolls. Thank yoy in advance.
You didn't need too. Republicans just don't support it now get back to doing what your parents made you, nothing more than that
Its a really hurtful way to look at the world.
Talent has nothing to Do, she Is Talking out of line she could shut her damn mouth. This ain't the 40's no ones cares about woman have the say in society, stop Talking.
Name calling the people you differ with, isn't a real good conversation starter
Please take the time to think before speaking your beliefs. Do some research yourself so that you could share the TRUTH, too.
That sounds awfully fascist of you: it's clear those people are trying to help other than hurting you!   Education, brother
You can make the same point MORE SOBERLY
Just cause someone does weird stuff now and then it doesn"t automatically invalidate their character for ever. Give him a chance guys, jeees
Your sister seems highly intelligent and I am glad she has opinions besides her normal one (which usually being a brain in a corset).  My condolences.
Please do not use derogatory racial slurs.
Your point is hindered by the words "demeetae cunt-fuck", which have no basis in fact whatsoever. We appreciate facts. Let more knowledge spill across the thread.
The C Wut?  Call an AdUckTtoRR if u don't mean it Iran?
When speaking directly with your communication will help make the message troubling, hurtful. Be nicer to each other please ✋👮�
It seems he is intelligent since we don't often if at atall hear about people like that. The media loves stories that have a twist that will sell or they want the views and it seems our attention spans want quicker content. It sucks to get old. Maybe it's because kids today are so lazy. Haha
Multiple profany and demagging slurs will cause your account banishme
Hey maybe there is merrit in thinking and examining other people's behaviors as you need to to be better person, I the beginning, but at other moment stop, maybe you want to hurt them, not realize it now then go to jail, you are no better than anyone then if so then just leave all of people. I'm sure with all your knowledge you wont run out of opportunity to show who ya is� .
